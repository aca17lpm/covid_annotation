Earlier, PM Modi had appealed to people to switch off lights at 9 PM for 9 mins on 05 April & light candle, \u2018Diya\u2019 or mobile\u2019s flashlight, to mark fight against COVID-19. Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of a fire accident that took place at the Solapur Airport on 05 April 2020.Fact: A fire accident took place at the Solapur Airport as a result of the bursting of crackers on 05 April 2020, but the video is not related to that accident. It is that of the fire accident that took place at the Solapur Airport on 03 February 2020. So, the claim is MISLEADING.\u00a0 \u00a0On reverse image search of the screenshots from the video, a news video of \u2018ABP Majha\u2019 was obtained in the search results. It had the same visuals as that of the video posted and is found to be of the fire accident at the Solapur Airport on 03 February 2020. As per a news report, a fire broke out at the Solapur Airport at 7 PM on 03 February 2020 and the fire officials have brought the fire under control by dousing it. The article mentioned that the exact reason for the fire accident was yet to be ascertained.As per the article of \u2018The New Indian Express\u2019, an official of Solapur Airport has said that a minor fire broke out at the airport on 05 April 2020. Prima facie, it is believed that the firecrackers burst by some people while responding to PM Modi\u2019s call to switch off lights at 9 pm might be the reason. Airports Authority of India (AAI) has also put out a tweet regarding the accident and clarified that there was no damage to the property due to the accident and also it hasn\u2019t affected the airport operations.\u00a0Alert Airport Fire Safety Team, Solapur Airport along with City Fire Brigade extinguished the sudden grass fire that broke out in the operational area of the airport yesterday night. No damage caused to the airport property and no adverse impact on airport operations. #AAI\u2014 Airports Authority of India (@AAI_Official) April 6, 2020 To conclude, an old video shared as recent fire accident at the Solapur Airport on 05 April 2020Did you watch our new video?

Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of Muslims being trained to sneeze purposefully to spread Coronavirus.Fact: It is an old video. While the first Corona positive case in India was reported on 30 January 2020 in Kerala, the video was found being shared, in the context of Pakistan, on the internet at least since 29 January 2020. Also, the people in the video were not being trained to spread Coronavirus. They are doing a type of \u2018Zikr\u2019, a Sufi ritual, which involves body movement and heavy breathing. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. When the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, many similar videos, posted in January, were found in the search results. While the first Corona positive case in India was reported on 30 January 2020 in Kerala, the video was found being shared, in the context of Pakistan, on the internet at least since 29 January 2020. Many people on social media have shared the same video as related to Pakistan, which can be seen here and here. \u00a0Also, a TikTok star from Pakistan has posted the same video on his Facebook account on 30 January 2020. So, a two-month-old video that went viral in Pakistan is being shared now in India in the context of the Tablighi Jamaat incident. A Facebook user has posted the same video with the title \u2013 \u2018Sufi people doing strange rituals.When searched if there is any such Sufi ritual, it was found that there are various orders among Sufis and each of them follows various rituals. One of those rituals, \u2018Zikr\u2019, is similar to the one shown in the video. Videos related to \u2018Zikr\u2019 can be watched here, here, here and here. But, even \u2018Zikr\u2019 is followed using different methods by different Sufi orders. In a \u2018Zikr\u2019 method called \u2018Pan Anfas\u2019, a combination of concentration, body movement, and heavy breathing is followed. More information regarding it can be read here.To sum it up, a Sufi ritual video falsely shared as \u2018Muslims being trained to sneeze to spread COVID-19\u2019. Did you watch our new video?

Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim in the message.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) will be spraying medicine in the air after 10 PM tonight in order to kill COVID-19.Fact: The BBMP Commissioner and the Mayor have clarified that the message is just a rumor and the BBMP has no such plans to spray any medicine for COVID-19. So, the claim is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 On checking the Twitter account of BBMP Commissioner to know if BBMP is planning to spray any medicine for COVID-19 in Bengaluru city, a tweet by him on 18 March was found. In his tweet, B.H. Anil Kumar (Commissioner of BBMP) has said that the message is just a rumour and the BBMP has no plans to spray any medicine for COVID-19. The same can also be found in a tweet by BBMP Mayor M. Goutham Kumar. When a similar message went viral across the country saying that the Government of India will spray Coronavirus vaccine gas, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has debunked the claim and clarified that the Government is doing no such thing and the message is \u2018fake\u2019.Also, when a similar message went viral in Oman saying that the Government of Oman is spraying Coronavirus pesticide in the country to combat the spread of COVID-19, the Ministry of Health (Oman) has said that it is a rumour and no such operation is planned.To sum it up, the message that BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) will be spraying medicine in the air to kill COVID-19 is just a rumour.

The vaccine by Israeli scientists is yet to be approved  0 By Akhil Reddy  on  March 11, 2020    A A A    Twitter  Facebook  Reddit A post is being shared widely on social media with a claim that Israel scientists have discovered a vaccine for COVID-19 and there will be no more COVID-19 deaths. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: No more deaths from COVID-19 as Israel scientists have discovered a vaccine for COVID-19.Fact: Various vaccines proposed by Israel scientists and other researchers across the world are under development and are yet to be cleared for production and distribution. Israel\u2019s MIGAL Research Institute is also in the process of producing a vaccine for COVID-19. According to WHO, as on 11 March 2020, there is no vaccine for COVID-19. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.\u00a0\u00a0 On the WHO website, it can be read that, \u2018to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19\u2019.When searched on Google about Israeli scientists discovering a vaccine for COVID-19, various news articles were found in the search results. According to an article in \u2018The Jerusalem Post\u2019, Israel\u2019s MIGAL Research Institute is in the process of developing a vaccine for COVID-19. Also, the vaccine is yet to go through the regulatory process. The same can be found on the website of MIGAL Galilee Research Institute. David Zigdon, CEO of MIGAL Galilee Research Institute, said, \u201cGiven the urgent global need for a human coronavirus vaccine, we are doing everything we can to accelerate development. Our goal is to produce the vaccine during the next 8-10 weeks, and to achieve safety approval in 90 days\u201d. Also, in the \u2018DRAFT landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines \u2013 4 March 2020\u2019 document released by WHO, 35 candidate vaccines are listed (all of them are at the pre-clinical stage). The name of \u2018MIGAL Galilee Research Institute\u2019 can be seen in the list and its vaccine is also at the pre-clinical stage. So, the vaccine being developed by Israeli scientists is not yet approved for human consumption.Also, on 6 March 2020, WHO has tweeted that \u201cso far WHO has received applications for review & approval of 40 diagnostic tests, 20 vaccines are in development & many clinical trials of therapeutics are underway\u201c. A vaccine must go through various stages of development before it gets distributed among the public. More info regarding the vaccine approval process can be found here and here.The posted Coronavirus vaccine photo is taken from \u2018Alamy\u2019 (stock pictures website).To sum it up, as of today, there is no vaccine for COVID-19. The vaccine by Israeli scientists is yet to be approved.Did you watch our new video?   Share.

Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of bats found under the tiles of many roofs in Hubei, China. They were the source of Coronavirus.Fact: The video was not taken in China. It\u2019s an old video uploaded on 05 July 2011 by a Miami based roofing company called \u2018Istueta Roofing\u2019. The bats in the video were found under the tiles during the process of replacing a roof for a customer in Miami (US). Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.From the \u2018Economic Times\u2019 article, it is learnt that some of the studies suspect that the 2019 novel Coronavirus may have come from bats. But, WHO has officially not yet declared the origin/source of the virus.Using the \u2018Invid\u2019 plugin, keyframes of the video were obtained. When these keyframes were reverse image searched using \u2018Yandex\u2019, the same video was found to be uploaded on Youtube by \u2018Istueta Roofing\u2019 on 05 July 2011. According to the description given below the video by the uploader, it is understood that the bats were found in the process of removing tiles from a customer\u2019s old roof in Miami (US) by a roofing company called \u2018Istueta Roofing\u2019, which offers services for roofing needs in South Florida. So, this is not a video from China as mentioned in the post. More information about \u2018Istueta Roofing\u2019 can be found here. To summarize, a video that was posted by a Miami based roofing company in 2011 is being falsely shared in the context of the coronavirus outbreak in China.

Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.  \u00a0\u00a0On the WHO\u2019s website, \u2018runny nose\u2019 can be seen in the symptoms list of COVID-19.The \u2018sputum production\u2019 can be seen as a symptom of COVID-19 in the \u2018Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\u2019 (submitted on 28 February 2020).Also, according to \u2018AFP\u2019 article, there is no medical expert with the name \u2018Dr. Khin Maung U\u2019 at a hospital in Shenzhen and also, there is no \u201cShenzhen Hospital\u201d. Previously, FACTLY has debunked the claim that garlic protects people from the new Coronavirus; the article can be read here.To sum it up, \u2018runny nose\u2019 and \u2018sputum production\u2019 are also symptoms of COVID-19.Did you watch our new video?

Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: After husband tested positive for coronavirus, wife fled from Banglore to Agra .Fact: The woman went to her parents place in Agra on 9 March, while her husband was confirmed positive for coronavirus on 12 March. Also, she didn\u2019t enter Bangalore city. Karnataka government has also clarified that the woman didn\u2019t flee to her parents\u2019 place. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 When searched about the posted information on the internet, an article published by \u2018Times of India\u2019 on 14 March 2020 was found. From the article, it can be read that \u201cAccording to health officials, the woman, who recently returned from her honeymoon in Italy and Greece and was put under quarantine after her husband showed symptoms of the disease. She escaped from Bengaluru on 08 March, took a flight to New Delhi and travelled to Agra to be with her parents.\u201d However, TOI later updated the article stating that the women left Bangalore on 09 March before her husband was not tested positive for coronavirus. Her husband was tested positive on 12 March. In the same article, it can be read that the couple travelled to Greece, Switzerland and France but not to Italy as mentioned in the post. So, the woman did not flee from quarantine as she left directly from Bengaluru airport on 09 March before her husband was tested positive.Karnataka\u2019s medical education minister, K.Sudhakar has clarified that the couple reached Bengaluru on 08 March at 9:45 pm from Mumbai and from there the woman took an early morning flight at 1:40 am on 09 March to New Delhi, and from there, she took the 8.10 am Gatimaan Express train to Agra. A flowchart\u00a0released by the Karnataka government\u00a0showing the whereabouts of the Google employee can be seen below.\u00a0More information related to this case can be seen\u00a0here, and here.To sum it up, the news that the wife fled to her parents\u2019 place after her husband was tested positive for coronavirus is false.

Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in those posts.Claim: Videos of Pigs being buried in China due to the Coronavirus outbreak.Fact:  The videos posted are old. They are in no way related to the recent Coronavirus outbreak. So, the claim is FALSE.Video-1 (Archived): The video can be seen to have been uploaded on Youtube in March 2019. In the description, it is mentioned that the pigs were buried due to the outbreak of \u2018African Swine Fever\u2019. Also, the novel Coronavirus was first reported in the last week of December 2019. So, this video is not related to the recent Coronavirus outbreak. Video-2 (Archived): The video can be seen to have been uploaded on Youtube in March 2019. In the YouTube video, the clip related to the video-1 can also be seen. So, this video is also not related to the recent Coronavirus outbreak.Video-3 (Archived):This video is also found to have been uploaded in November 2019. In the description, it is mentioned that the pigs were buried due to the outbreak of \u2018Hog Cholera\u2019. As the outbreak of Coronavirus was first reported in the last week of December 2019, this video is also not related to the recent Coronavirus outbreak.More information regarding the diseases like African Swine Fever and Hog Cholera in pigs can be found here, here and here. The differences between the \u2018African Swine Fever\u2019 and \u20182019 novel Coronavirus\u2019 can be read here.To sum it up, old videos are being falsely shared as \u2018Pigs buried in China due to the Coronavirus outbreak\u2019.Did you watch our new video in the DECODE series?

SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus is just a new type of Coronavirus  0 By Akhil Reddy  on  March 27, 2020    A A A    Twitter  Facebook  Reddit A lot of posts with images and videos are being shared on Facebook with a claim that humans knew about COVID-19 much before its outbreak in 2020. While some have posted the video clip of a Netflix series (\u2018My Secret Terrius\u2019) as a proof, others have posted an image of Ramesh Gupta\u2019s Zoology textbook claiming that it contains the medicine for COVID-19. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found here.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: COVID-19 was known to humans before its outbreak in 2020.Fact: The new SAR-CoV-2 virus (which cause COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019. All the old images and videos being shared on social media refer to the virus as Coronavirus, not as SAR-CoV-2 (or COVID-19). Coronaviruses were known to human decades ago. All the references made on social media were about the Coronaviruses, a general term for various viruses which cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Hence the claims made in the posts areMISLEADING.\u00a0\u00a0 On looking at both the image and video, it can be observed that both just refer to the term \u2018Coronavirus\u2019. On the WHO website, it can be read that \u2018Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.\u00a0 In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.\u2019 So, just a reference to \u2018Coronavirus\u2019, in the image and video, cannot directly link them to the SAR-CoV-2 virus (a type of Coronavirus which causes COVID-19).In the \u2018Virology\u2019 magazine published in 2012, it can be read that \u2018coronavirus disease was first described in 1931, with the first coronavirus (HCoV-229E) isolated from humans in 1965\u2019. Before COVID-19, two other disease outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS\u2010CoV in 2012) were also caused in humans by Coronaviruses. More information about the previous strains of Coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2 (previously called as 2019-nCoV) can be seen here and types of Human Coronaviruses can be found be here.In the Zoology textbook, it was given that \u2018common cold is caused by various kinds of viruses. In 75 percent of cases, it is due to Rhinovirus and in remaining cases, it is due to Coronavirus\u2019. It does not mention about SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. The medicines suggested in the book were for the treatment of common cold, not for COVID-19. On the WHO website, it can be read that, \u2018to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019\u2019. Also, the Press Information Bureau has clarified that the viral message is \u2018fake\u2019.\u0915\u094b\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0935\u093e\u092f\u0930\u0938 \u092a\u0930 \u0909\u092a\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u092d\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0915 \u0938\u0902\u0926\u0947\u0936\u094b \u0938\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0935\u0927\u093e\u0928 \u0930\u0939\u0947\u0902 | #coronavirus infection \u092a\u0930 \u0939\u092e\u0947\u0936\u093e \u0938\u091f\u0940\u0915 \u091c\u093e\u0928\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0932\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0923 \u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0932\u092f, \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u093f\u0936\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0947\u0936\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u094b \u092a\u0922\u093c\u0947 | pic.twitter.com/h34a6AygeC\u2014 PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) March 22, 2020 Coming to the video clip of Netflix series (\u2018My Secret Terrius\u2019), it also just refers to the term \u2018Coronavirus\u2019 and says that the mortality rate of the new mutant virus is almost 90 percent. But, the overall mortality rate of COVID-19 was reported to be just around 5 percent. While the virus mentioned in the video clip affects a human in just 5 minutes, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has an incubation period of 1- 14 days. So, just a reference to \u2018Coronavirus\u2019 excited the social media users to share the video in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.Previously, a photo of a Dettol bottle, manufactured in October 2019, was also shared with a claim that Dettol can kill the new coronavirus, as \u2018Coronavirus\u2019 was mentioned on the bottle. FACTLY has debunked the claim and wrote a fact-check article, which can be read here.To sum it up, Coronaviruses were known to humans decades ago.

Let\u2019s try to find out the authenticity of the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Gargling warm water with either salt or vinegar can eliminate Coronavirus.Fact: The World Health Organisation (WHO) or Indian government has not mentioned anywhere that the gargling of warm water with salt or vinegar can eliminate coronavirus. Indian government\u2019s Press Information Bureau (PIB) has also said that the message that was circulating on social media is fake. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 When searched to find out if the usage of warm water with salt or vinegar can eliminate Coronavirus, no credible information from the World Health Organisation (WHO) or Indian government was found. Earlier, when the same message (gargling of warm water with salt can prevent the spread of coronavirus) was circulated, WHO has sent an email to \u2018AFP\u2018 that they don\u2019t have any concrete evidence to substantiate that news.According to the WHO, there is no vaccine to treat COVID-19 yet. From the information found on the National Institute of Health (NIH) website, an investigational vaccine (mRNA-1273) developed by a company is being tested in America. However, it takes time\u00a0to find out if the vaccine is efficient enough to treat COVID-19. \u2018PIB Fact Check\u2019 has also\u00a0tweeted that the above message that\u2019s been circulating on social media is false. PIB is the official public information department of the central government.#Coronavirus CANNOT be treated by gargling with warm water mixed with salt and vinegar.This is #fakenews circulating on social media and WhatsApp.For authentic information on #Coronavirusoutbreak, follow @PIB_India and @MoHFW_INDIA #PIBFactCheck #IndiaFightsCorona pic.twitter.com/gKUGDBqR9Q\u2014 PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) March 16, 2020 The information about the protective measures advised by the WHO to prevent coronavirus can be found on their website.To sum it up, there is no proof that gargling with warm water and salt or vinegar can eliminate Coronavirus.Did you watch our new video?

Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: 2019 novel Coronavirus can be cured by one bowl of freshly boiled garlic.Fact: World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a clarification that garlic may have some antimicrobial properties but there is no evidence that it can protect people from the 2019 novel Coronavirus. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.When searched for information on garlic and its efficacy to cure Coronavirus, it was found that the World Health Organization (WHO) has already issued a clarification, regarding garlic, on its website. On the WHO website, it can be read that \u2018garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the new coronavirus.\u2019 Also, on the website, it can be read that \u2018to date, there is no specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the novel coronavirus\u2019.Many other myths regarding the novel Coronavirus have been busted by WHO, which can be seen below.To sum it up, \u2018Garlic is healthy but no evidence that it protects people from the new Coronavirus\u2019, says WHO.Did you watch our new video in the DECODE series?

A widely viral social media post claims that the preventive measures in the message were suggested by the UNICEF.The archived version of the post can be found here.But, before fact-checking the message, let\u2019s try to know a bit about the virus. Now, let\u2019 verify the claims made in the post.Claim 1: Precautionary measures suggested by the UNICEF.Fact: The viral message was not issued by the UNICEF. Some of the measures suggested in the message contradict the WHO\u2019S view on COVID-19. Also, some have no scientific evidence. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0UNICEF mainly caters to the needs of the children and young people across the globe. On the UNICEF\u2019s website, it can be seen that it advised the parents on how to protect themselves and their children from COVID-19. Most of the measures suggested in the viral social media message were not found on the UNICEF\u2019s website and some of the measures contradict the UNICEF\u2019s and WHO\u2019s views (on the use of mask and warm weather reducing the outbreak).Claim 2: Wearing a mask can prevent people from getting infected by COVID-19 since corona virus is large in size with a diameter of 400-500 micronsFact: According to WHO, people with no respiratory symptoms do not need to wear a medical mask. It recommends the use of masks for people who have symptoms of COVID-19 and for those taking care of individuals who have symptoms. Also, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted. Secondly, the size of the corona virus is not 400-500 microns, it is only 0.12 microns. Hence, the claim made in the post is onlyPARTIALLY TRUE.  \u00a0\u00a0On the WHO\u2019s website, in the FAQ section on Coronavirus, it can be read that people with no symptoms need not wear a medical mask. It reads, \u2018WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and misuse of masks. Use a mask only if you have respiratory symptoms (coughing or sneezing), have suspected COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms, or are caring for someone with suspected COVID-19 infection\u2019. Even CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) does not recommend masks to healthy people.In one of the advisories released by the WHO, it can also be read that, \u2018the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted. If masks are to be used, this measure must be combined with hand hygiene and other IPC measures to prevent the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCov\u2026Wearing medical masks when not indicated may cause unnecessary cost, procurement burden and create a false sense of security that can lead to neglecting other essential measures such as hand hygiene practices. Furthermore, using a mask incorrectly may hamper its effectiveness to reduce the risk of transmission\u2019. The guidelines regarding how to use masks can be watched here.Talking about the use of masks, \u2018The Guardian\u2019 writes, \u2018Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won\u2019t get sick \u2013 viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness)\u2026masks will probably make little difference if you\u2019re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply\u2019.On its website, WHO writes, \u2018Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely\u2019.According to an article published in \u2018The New England Journal of Medicine\u2019, \u2018the electron micrographs of negative-stained 2019-nCoV particles were generally spherical with some pleomorphism. Diameter varied from about 60 to 140 nm. Virus particles had quite distinctive spikes, about 9 to 12 nm, and gave virions the appearance of a solar corona\u2019. So, the size of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is around 125 nm (0.125 microns). The smallest particles are 0.06 microns, and the largest are 0.14 microns. The electron microscopy image showing SARS-CoV-2 virus can be seen here.An article published by the \u2018Business Insider\u2019 talks about the types of masks and their effectiveness. It can be read here. \u00a0Eric Toner, a scientist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says the following about wearing a mask, \u2018There\u2019s little harm in it. But it\u2019s not likely to be very effective in preventing it\u2019. In the \u2018Daily Mail\u2019 article, it can be read that \u2018surgical masks, which have proved popular, rarely filter out particles smaller than 5 microns \u2013 and coronavirus is only 0.12 microns\u2019.Claim 3: Coronavirus live up to 12 hours on metal, 9 hours on fabric, and 10 minutes on the human hand.Fact: According to WHO, \u2018the studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days.\u2019 There are no defined timelines for each surface. The topic is yet to be studied and confirmed. Hence the claim made in the post remains UNVERIFIED.  \u00a0\u00a0On the WHO website, it can be read that \u2018it is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment)\u2019.An explainer by \u2018Reuters\u2019 on \u2018How long can coronavirus survive on surfaces?\u2019 can be read here and an analysis of earlier studies on similar coronaviruses can be read here. There is no defined answer on the topic. It is yet to be studied and confirmed.Claim 4: Outbreak of COVID-19 will be stopped by the hot weather conditions.Fact: As of now, there is no scientific evidence to show that hot weather conditions will stop the outbreak of COVID-19. According to the CDC, \u2018it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather becomes warmer.\u2019. Hence, the claim made in the post remains UNVERIFIED.  \u00a0\u00a0In an article published by the \u2018National Geographic\u2019 on the topic, it can be read that, \u2018viruses that cause influenza or milder coronavirus colds do tend to subside in warmer months because these types of viruses have what scientists refer to as \u201cseasonality\u201d. But it\u2019s highly uncertain that SARS-CoV-2 will behave the same way. Those currently studying the disease say their research is too early to predict how the virus will respond to changing weather\u2019. Similar views about the virus can be also seen in the \u2018Will heat kill the coronavirus?\u2019 article, published in the \u2018New Scientist\u2019.According to the CDC, \u2018it is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.\u00a0 At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather becomes warmer.\u00a0 There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing\u2019. The same can be seen on the WHO\u2019s website. WHO\u2019s Dr Maria Van Kerkhove\u2019s answer on the same topic can be watched here. Claim 5: Gargling with warm water and salt will prevent COVID-19.Fact: WHO does not mention \u2018gargling with warm water and salt\u2019 as a preventive measure. In an email to AFP, the WHO said, \u2018We have seen no convincing evidence that rinsing one\u2019s mouth with diluted saline water will provide protection from this disease\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.In a press release regarding misinformation on Coronavirus, UNICEF has clarified that the message circulating on social media as UNICEF communication is not true. Also, \u2018UNICEF Cambodia\u2019 has tweeted the photo of the message and called it \u2018fake\u2019.We would like to inform our audiences that the news below attributed to UNICEF is fake.

The archived version of the post can be found hereClaim: Most affected countries by COVID-19 are along the same 40-degree North latitude.Fact: 40-degree North latitude passes through some of the countries most affected by COVID-19 but does not pass through half of the locations given in the post. Also, it does not touch Wuhan (Hubei Province \u2013 where around 60% of all the positive cases are reported), which is at around 30-degree North latitude. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 In the world map, it can be seen that 40-degree North latitude passes through the following countries: Spain, Italy, Albania, Greece, Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan Kyrgyzstan, China, North Korea, Japan, US, and Portugal. The list of countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can be found on the WHO website. The top-10 most affected countries (as on 12 March 2020) are China, Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, France, Spain, Germany, US, Switzerland, and Japan.When we compare both the lists, it can be found there are only four countries (US, Spain, China, and Japan) through which the 40-degree North passes and are in the top-10 most affected countries. There are many more countries through which the 40-degree North passes and are not in the top-10 most affected list. Also, no positive COVID-19 cases were reported (as on 12 March 2020) in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. [Also, North Korea]Even among the four countries, through which the 40-degree North\npasses and are in the top-10 most affected countries, in the US and China, it\ncan be observed that the 40-degree North does not pass through the most\naffected region in the respective country. The most affected regions in the US\nand China are Washington State and Hubei Province (Wuhan) respectively. The 40-degree\nNorth does not pass through them.To sum it up, not all the countries most affected by COVID-19 are on\nthe 40-degree North latitude.Did you watch our new video?   Share.

There is no harm in consuming thoroughly cooked meat  0 By Anusha Rao  on  March 18, 2020    A A A    Twitter  Facebook  Reddit A post with a photo of goat\u2019s meat with dark spots is being shared on Facebook with a claim that coronavirus was found in goat meat and it advises people not to consume meat. Let\u2019s try to find the authenticity of the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Coronavirus was found in mutton.Fact: The photo in the post was edited. Also, the photo was taken five or six years ago. WHO and FSSAI have also mentioned that properly cooked meat can be consumed. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 When the photo in the post was searched using Google reverse image technique, a \u2018justdial\u2019 link with the same photo was found in the search results. By comparing the two pictures, it can be noticed that the posted picture has more spots than the original photo. Furthermore, when \u2018Khaja A1 \u2013 Mutton Shop\u2019, who posted the original picture on the \u2018justdial\u2019 website was contacted by FACTLY it was found that the photo was uploaded around 5 or 6 years ago. But, coronavirus outbreak was first reported last year in December. So, the original photo on social media was edited and is being shared as if it is infected with coronavirus.The CEO of FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India), G.S.G. Iyengar has also mentioned\u00a0that there is no scientific data till date to prove that the consumption of chicken, mutton and other non-vegetarian foods can cause the spread of coronavirus.\u00a0Also, in the press release\u00a0of FSSAI and in the WHO (World Health Organisation)\u00a0website\u00a0it can be seen that properly cooked meat is safe to eat.The minister of Dairy, animal husbandry and fisheries, Shandilya Giriraj Singh has also tweeted\u00a0that the consumption of chicken, meat, fish and eggs doesn\u2019t cause the transmission of Coronavirus.\u092d\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0902\u0924\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0935\u0927\u093e\u0928:-\u092e\u091f\u0928 ,\u091a\u093f\u0915\u0928 \u0905\u0923\u094d\u0921\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u092e\u091b\u0932\u0940 \u0916\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u094b\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0935\u093e\u0907\u0930\u0938 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u0902\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0923 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948! pic.twitter.com/Ai9S75AZO5\u2014 Shandilya Giriraj Singh (@girirajsinghbjp) March 12, 2020 Previously, when the message that chicken consumption causes coronavirus transmission went viral, FACTLY debunked it as Fake news and the article can be read here.To sum it up, the photo in the post was edited.

It was taken before the recent Coronavirus outbreak. Also, the Minister for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries has clarified that there is no evidence to show that eating mutton can transmit Coronavirus. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 When the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same video was found in the search results. The video was found to be uploaded on YouTube on 12 December 2019. But the recent Coronavirus epidemic was reported to have begun in the last week of December 2019. So, the video is not related to the recent \u2018SARS-CoV-2\u2019 Coronavirus. When a similar video went viral in UAE, their government has clarified that \u2018the footage is old\u2019.Also, the Minister for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Shandilya Giriraj Singh has tweeted that the consumption of chicken, mutton, fish, and eggs doesn\u2019t cause the transmission of Coronavirus.\u092d\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0902\u0924\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0938\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0935\u0927\u093e\u0928:-\u092e\u091f\u0928 ,\u091a\u093f\u0915\u0928 \u0905\u0923\u094d\u0921\u093e \u0914\u0930 \u092e\u091b\u0932\u0940 \u0916\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u0915\u094b\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0935\u093e\u0907\u0930\u0938 \u0915\u093e \u0938\u0902\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0923 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948! pic.twitter.com/Ai9S75AZO5\u2014 Shandilya Giriraj Singh (@girirajsinghbjp) March 12, 2020 Previously, when the message that chicken consumption causes coronavirus went viral, FACTLY debunked it as Fake news and the article can be read here.To sum it up, an old video falsely shared as \u2018goats affected by Coronavirus\u2019.Did you watch our new video?

The post claims that the first photo is of the people who died from Coronavirus in Italy and the second one is of Italy\u2019s Prime Minister crying and expressing his helplessness that he couldn\u2019t save Coronavirus patients in Italy. Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim 1: Image of the people who died of Coronavirus in Italy.Fact: The photo is not related to recent Coronavirus deaths in Italy. It was taken in Frankfurt (Germany) in 2014 as part of an \u2018art project\u2019 in remembrance of 528 Katzbach victims of the Nazi concentration camp. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 When the photo in the post was reverse image searched, the photo was found in an\u00a0article published by a news organization, \u2018South China Morning Post\u2019. The article was published in 2014 and the photo credits were given to an organization called \u2018Reuters\u2019. Based on the description provided on Reuters\u2019 website about the photo, it is understood that the photo was captured when some people had laid down on a pedestrian zone as part of an \u2018art project\u2019 in Frankfurt (Germany), in remembrance of 528 Katzbach victims of the Nazi concentration camp.Claim 2: Photo of the prime minister of Italy crying and expressing his helplessness that he couldn\u2019t save Coronavirus patients in Italy.Fact: The person in the photo is not the PM of Italy. He is Jair Bolsonaro, the President of Brazil. The photo was taken when he cried at an \u2018Evangelical Thanksgiving Service\u2019. The PM of Italy has not expressed helplessness that he couldn\u2019t save Coronavirus affected patients in Italy. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0 When the posted photo was cropped and searched using reverse image technique, the same photo was found in an\u00a0article published on 17 December 2019 by a news organization called \u2018Poder 360\u2019. From the article, it is understood that the person in the photo is the President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro. The photo was taken when he participated in an \u2018Evangelical Thanksgiving Service\u2019, where he cried remembering the knife attack, which he suffered during the 2018 election campaign in Juiz de Fora (MG). So, the person in the posted photo is the President of Brazil, not the prime minister of Italy.When searched on the internet to see if the PM of Italy (Giuseppe Conte) has commented that he couldn\u2019t save Coronavirus affected people in Italy, no such information published by any trusted news agency was found. Also, no information about it was found on the official Twitter account\u00a0of Giuseppe Conte. Therefore, the PM of Italy has not expressed his helplessness that he couldn\u2019t save Coronavirus affected patients in Italy.\u00a0To summarize, unrelated photos are being falsely shared in the context of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy.Did you watch our new video?

The worst part is all are Muslims and ROAMING freely with chappal inside the temple\u2019. Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found hereClaim: The Government of Andhra Pradesh has made Kanipakam temple a quarantine center for coronavirus suspects.Fact: The building in the video is not Kanipakam temple, it is a pilgrim lodge (\u2018Sri Ganesh Sadan\u2019) in Kanipakam that is being used as a quarantine center by the Andhra Pradesh government. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0 \u00a0When one goes through the video carefully, a board with the name \u2018Sri Ganesh Sadan\u2019 can be seen on the building. So, when searched on Google with the text \u2018Sri Ganesh Sadan Kanipakam\u2019, a pilgrim lodge is found to exist with that name in Kanipakam. When one goes through the photos of that lodge, the building in the video can be seen. So, it is not a temple as claimed in the post. As it is a lodge, people can be seen wearing footwear in Google photos too.An article of \u2018Eenadu\u2019 with the news that \u2018Sri Ganesh Sadan\u2019 will be used as a quarantine center in Kanipakam can be read here.To summarize, the quarantine center seen in the video is not Kanipakam \u2018temple\u2019; it\u2019s a \u2018pilgrim lodge\u2019 in Kanipakam.Did you watch our new video?

Let\u2019s check the veracity of the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found hereClaim: A worker of Prince hotel in Mehdipatnam has tested positive for Coronavirus.Fact: The message is fake. In Telangana state, till date, only one confirmed case of Coronavirus is reported and the person who tested positive for the virus is a Software Engineer. So, the claim is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 When searched if any case of Coronavirus was reported in Mehdipatnam, no news reports confirming it were found. On visiting the \u2018Ministry of Health and Family Welfare\u2019 website for the number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus reported in the Telangana state, it was found to be one. In Telangana, the confirmed case of Coronavirus is a Software Engineer from Bangalore. And, the case was reported on 2 March 2020 i.e. prior to the date (8 March 2020) on which the Facebook post about the worker of Prince hotel was posted. So, the message is a fake one.Yesterday, Telangana Health Minister Etela Rajendra has said that there is no case of Coronavirus in the state now. The person who had earlier tested positive for the virus has now been tested negative and will be discharged soon.To summarize, the message that a worker of Prince hotel in Mehdipatnam, Hyderabad has tested positive for Coronavirus is fake.

In the posted video, the news anchor reads out the Facebook posts put by various users, in which they criticize Sharukh Khan for the donation and goes on to tell that Sharukh hasn\u2019t made any donation to any mishaps or accidents in India. Let\u2019s try to analyze the authenticity of the video.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: India TV telecasted news that Bollywood Actor Shahrukh Khan donated 45 Crore Rupees to Pakistan Oil tanker blast victims.Fact: The video is a clipped version of India TV\u2019s fact-check video. In the original fact-check video, India TV has debunked the same claim and concluded that Shahrukh has not made any donation to Pakistan Oil tanker blast victims. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.When searched with the keywords shown in the video, the full version of the video was found on the YouTube channel of \u2018India TV\u2019. In the video, the channel has fact-checked posts on social media that went viral in 2017 claiming that Shahrukh Khan has donated 45 Crore Rupees to the victims of Pakistan Oil tanker blast. The channel debunked the claim and concluded that Sharukh Khan\u2019s Media Team has clarified to them that such news is baseless and Sharukh Khan hasn\u2019t made any donation to the victims of Pakistan Oil tanker blast. In the Fact-check video, the news reporter has also read out the instances in the past when Sharukh Khan took up charitable activities in India and made donations to the victims of natural disasters in the country.On 25 June 2017, an Oil tanker has overturned and exploded at Bahawalpur in Pakistan, leading to the death of more than 150 people. More information about the accident can be read here.To sum it up, India TV\u2019s fact-check video was clipped to falsely claim that Sharukh Khan has donated 45 Crore Rupees to Pakistan Oil tanker blast victims.

Also, social media users were questioning about how Dettol company knew about the Coronavirus back in October 2019 (novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first reported from Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019). Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Dettol kills Coronavirus. The company knew about the Coronavirus back in October 2019.Fact: The \u2018Coronavirus\u2019 mentioned on Dettol bottle is the previous strains of Coronavirus, not the 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Also, Dettol manufacturer (\u2018RB\u2019) has clarified that they do not yet have more details of the new virus and are not yet in a position to confirm levels of effectiveness against the new strain. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.When searched about the news on Google, it was found that RB (Reckitt Benckiser), the manufacturer of Dettol, has given a clarification on the viral pictures claiming that Dettol can kill \u20182019-nCoV\u2019 virus. In the Livemint article, it can be read that the company said, \u2018As this is an emerging outbreak, RB, like all manufacturers, doesn\u2019t yet have access to the new virus (2019-nCoV) for testing and, as a result, are not yet in a position to confirm levels of effectiveness against the new strain\u2019.On the WHO website, it can be read that \u2018a novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. The new, or \u201cnovel\u201d coronavirus, now called 2019-nCoV, had not previously detected before the outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.\u2019. The \u2018Coronavirus\u2019 mentioned on the Dettol bottle is regarding some of the previous strains of Coronavirus, not about the 2019 novel Coronavirus. More information about the previous strains of Coronavirus and the 2019-nCoV can be seen here.To sum it up, \u2018Coronavirus\u2019 mentioned on Dettol was about some previous strains of Coronavirus, not 2019-nCoV.Did you watch our new video in the DECODE series?

Also, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has clarified that the message is \u2018fake\u2019. So, the claim isFALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 When searched on Google if the Government of India has announced a \u2018National Lockdown\u2019 in the country from 20 March, no information corroborating the same was found. On 19 March, PM Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation about Coronavirus outbreak, has asked people to practice \u2018social distancing\u2019 and to stay home as much as possible for the coming few weeks to combat COVID-19. Also, he assured that there is no shortage of essential goods and asked people to avoid panic buying. In his speech, Modi also asked the people of India to observe \u2018Janata Curfew\u2019 on 22 March by staying in their houses from 7 am to 9 pm. In his speech, PM Modi hasn\u2019t spoken anything about the \u2018National lockdown\u2019.When the same message went viral on 19 March saying that the things in it would feature in PM Modi\u2019s address to the nation about Coronavirus, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has debunked it and clarified that the messages of \u2018National Lockdown\u2019 are baseless.When researched further, it is found that the image shared in the post is part of a presentation submitted to the government by entrepreneurs across India.To sum it up, the Government of India hasn\u2019t announced a \u2018National Lockdown\u2019 in the country from 20 March.

Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: RBI extended the year closing till 30 June 2020.Fact: The normal financial year in India followed by the government & all other institutions including for taxation purpose is 01 April to 31 March. However, RBI\u2019s accounting/financial year is from 1 July to 30 June. There is no change in the normal financial year. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 Financial Year in IndiaThe financial year followed by the Government of India, all other organizations, companies and for the purpose of taxation, book keeping is 01 April to 31 March. The financial year for all tax compliance is also April to March.This was adopted during the British regime. Multiple committees were set up in the past to revisit the fiscal year calendar. However, nothing has changed. In 2016, the government appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Shankar Acharya to examine the desirability and feasibility of having \u2018a new financial year\u2019. It was reported that the committee recommended changing to a January to December financial year. However, the government has not taken any decision on this till date.What about RBI?The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on the other hand follows a July to June financial year. On the RBI website, it can be seen that the financial year of RBI is July to June. The same can be also seen in its Annual report. However, it has to be noted that this financial year has no bearing on other institutions like banks, companies or even the government which follow the April to March financial year.What about the viral post on social media?In the post, a link to a newspaper article is given. In the article, it can be read that \u2018fiscal 2019-20 will end on 30 June 2020 while fiscal year 2020-21 will begin on 1 July 2020 but ends on 31 March 2021\u2019 in the case of RBI. The article does not claim that RBI extended its current financial year till 30 June 2020 because it is already till 30 June 2020. So, there is no extension as claimed in the postOn the RBI website, it can be found that in a meeting of the Central Board of Directors of Reserve Bank of India, on 15 February 2020, \u2018the Board recommended aligning the financial year of RBI, currently July-June, with the Government\u2019s fiscal year (April-March) from the year 2020-21 and approved forwarding a proposal to the Government for its consideration\u2019.

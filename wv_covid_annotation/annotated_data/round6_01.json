No, an old unrelated video.  0 By Akhil Reddy  on  February 4, 2020    A A A    Twitter  Facebook  Reddit A video is being shared widely on social media with a claim that all the people shown in the video have died due to the recent novel Coronavirus outbreak. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim:  Video of a family died due to novel Coronavirus.Fact: The video was found on the internet at least since the last week of December 2019. But the first death from the novel Coronavirus was reported only in the second week of January 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.When the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, many similar videos were found in the search results. It can be found that the same video was uploaded on YouTube in December 2019. Also, a user has tweeted the same video on 1 January 2020, with a claim different from the post.While the exact context of the video cannot be ascertained, it is definitely not related to the novel Coronavirus outbreak; because the first death from novel Coronavirus was reported only in the second week of January 2020.To sum it up, an old unrelated video falsely shared as \u2018family died due to infection from the novel Coronavirus\u2019.Did you watch our new video in the DECODE series?

Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Image of dead bodies of Coronavirus victims in Italy.Fact: The image shows coffins containing the dead bodies of Lampedusa shipwreck victims. In 2013, a boat packed with around 500 African migrants caught fire and sank around half a mile from the Italian island Lampedusa leading to the death of more than 300 people. So, the claim isFALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 When the image is subjected to reverse image search technique, it was found in an article of \u2018The Guardian\u2019. The image had the following description with it- \u2018EU delegates, including Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, pay tribute before rows of coffins containing the bodies of Lampedusa shipwreck victims\u2019. As per the article, in October 2013, a boat packed with around 500 African migrants caught fire and sank around half a mile from the Italian island Lampedusa leading to the death of more than 300 people. So, the image is 6 years old and has nothing to do with the recent Coronavirus outbreak in Italy.Italy is facing a severe crisis due to COVID-19. The country has till now recorded about 75,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 7,500 deaths.To conclude, old images from 2013 are being falsely shared as \u2018Dead bodies of Coronavirus victims in Italy\u2019.To conclude, \u2018Mustard Oil\u2019 has many health benefits but using it will not prevent a person from getting infected with Coronavirus.

Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of American President Donald Trump announcing that Roche Medical Company will launch the vaccine for COVID-19 next Sunday.Fact: In the video, American President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t said that Roche Medical Company will launch the vaccine for COVID-19. He announced FDA\u2019s approval of a Coronavirus \u2018test\u2019 developed by a company \u2018Roche\u2019 to increase and accelerate the country\u2019s capacity to test for the virus. So, the claim isFALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 In the video clip posted, Donald Trump hands over the podium to Roche Diagnostics Chief Executive Officer for North America Matt Sause. Then Matt speaks- \u2018Thank you, Mr. President.\u00a0 So, from Roche, we want to thank the FDA for their rapid approval of our coronavirus test.\u00a0We really appreciate the partnership with the CDC and the FDA to get that to market as fast as possible because it\u2019s critical for us to make that available to help patients in need, and working with laboratories to get it up and going in the near future, which will bring hundreds of thousands of tests available to patients in need in the United States.\u00a0So, thank you\u2019. After Matt\u2019s speech, the clip ends with Trump saying- \u2018And you can do it.\u00a0 You can do it.\u00a0 A great company\u2019. So, in the video clip, Roche Diagnostics CEO for North America Matt Sause thanked FDA (U.S Food and Drug Administration) for rapid approval of the coronavirus test developed by their company.When searched with keywords, the full video of the clip posted was found on \u2018The White House\u2019 website. In that video dated 13 March 2020 (Friday), Trump declares \u2018National emergency\u2019 and then opens $50 billion for the states and territories to fight against the disease. Later, Trump announces that the FDA has approved a Coronavirus test developed by \u2018Roche\u2019 to increase and accelerate the country\u2019s capacity to test for the virus. He also said that he was expecting the availability of half a million additional tests early next week and would be announcing the locations for tests on Sunday. Later in the video, Vice President Pence and members of Coronavirus Task Force spoke in that press conference. From the Roche diagnostics website, it is found that the company has begun shipping of COVID-19 tests to laboratories across the US recently to begin testing of patients.As per the website of U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH), currently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with Coronavirus. But, Phase 1 of the clinical trial evaluating an investigational vaccine (mRNA-1273) designed to protect against COVID-19 has begun on 16 March. And it is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of that vaccine. The vaccine was developed by NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc.To sum it up, in the video, American President Donald Trump has announced that the FDA has approved a Coronavirus \u2018test\u2019 developed by a company \u2018Roche\u2019.

So, the claim is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s wife Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau was tested positive for Coronavirus and is in isolation since then.When the screenshots of the video were subjected to reverse image search, an article of \u2018Dailymail\u2019 was obtained in the search results.\u00a0 As per this article, the woman in the video is Tara Jane Langston, a waitress who contracted COVID-19 and is undergoing treatment at Hillingdon Hospital in London. She has filmed the video in an intensive care unit of the hospital pleading people to take COVID-19 seriously. Tara Jane Langston was admitted to the hospital on 15 March and was later diagnosed with COVID-19.

Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.When screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, it was found that the video is from Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and was taken in December 2019. It shows the violence that erupted during the anti-CAA protests in Shah-e-Alam area wherein the protestors pelted stones on several Police vans. So, the video is of an incident that took place prior to the introduction of lockdown in Gujarat to curb the spread of Coronavirus.

While Modi has asked people to clap as a sign of gratitude to the various groups working to eradicate COVID-19, some people are posting that clapping will create vibrations which will then kill Coronavirus by making it lose all potency. Also, it is being claimed the event was planned on a Sunday (i.e. on 22 March 2020) as it is \u2018Amavasya\u2019 (New Moon Day). Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: There is science behind PM Modi\u2019s 5 PM clapping initiative: Clapping generates vibration which can kill Coronavirus. Also, 22 March 2020 is Amavasya.Fact: There is no scientific evidence to prove that vibration from clapping hands can kill Coronavirus. The Press Information Bureau of India has clarified that the message is fake. Also, Amavasya is not on 22 March 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 Astrological Claim:First, let\u2019s check whether Amavasya is on 22 March 2020. It was found on the internet that \u2018Amavasya\u2019 is from 23 March 220 (12:30 PM) \u2013 24 March 2020 (02:58 PM), not on 22 March 2020. So, the theory that \u201822nd March is Amavasya, darkest day in a month. All virus, bacteria and evil forces have maximum potential and power on such days\u2019 will not apply to 22 March 2020 as it is not Amavasya. Also, Revathi Nakshatra is from 25 March 2020 (04:19 AM) \u2013 Mar 26 March 2020 (07:16 AM). Similar dates (Amavasya on 24 March 2020 and Revathi Nakshatra on 25 March 2020) can be also found on the \u2018Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams\u2019 website. So, the astrological significance mentioned in the post is false.Scientific Evidence: Now, let\u2019s check whether there is any scientific evidence to prove that clapping can kill Coronavirus. From various articles on the internet, it is found that ultrasound and laser pulses are being tested around the world to kill bacteria, viruses, and cancer cells. But no concrete evidence was found to prove that the vibration created from clapping hands can kill Coronavirus. If vibration from clapping hands could kill virus then WHO would have suggested the same. But no such preventive guidance can be found on the WHO website. Also, as the message went viral, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has clarified that \u2018the vibration generated by clapping together will not destroy Coronavirus infection\u2019.NO !

The claim with the video is that the Kenyan government is using Maasai tribe men to carry out stricter measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus in the country. Let\u2019s analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found hereClaim: Video of the Kenya Government using a Maasai tribe man to impose social distancing in Kenya.Fact: The video is made by an \u2018Entertainment\u2019 based YouTube channel \u2018Mbuzi Seller\u2019. It doesn\u2019t show a real-life incident. Also, there are no reports about the Kenyan government roping in Maasai tribe men to carry out stricter actions in the wake of Coronavirus infections in the country. So, the claim is FALSE.\u00a0 \u00a0The video in the post has the text \u2018Mbuzziseller\u2019 on it. So, when searched with that text, a YouTube channel with the same name was found in the results. In that channel, a longer version of the same video was found. When one goes through the video carefully, it can be found that the video was shot for \u2018Entertainment\u2019 purposes. In the description of the video, \u2018#Tanzania comedy\u2019 can be seen. When one goes through the other videos of that YouTube channel, the man can be seen in the same attire as in the video posted.Also, when searched if the Kenyan government roped in Maasai tribe men to carry out stricter actions, no reports were found. When the video went viral, a news website \u2018kenyans.co.ke\u2019 has debunked the claim, which can be seen here. To conclude, a video made by an \u2018Entertainment\u2019 based YouTube channel is being shared as \u2018Kenyan government using Maasai tribe men for carrying out stricter measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus\u2019.Did you watch our new video?

During the conversation, a person who claims to be a friend of a brother of World Health Organization-India Director says that the Government of India will announce the shutdown of the country in the coming days from 15 April to 15 June. Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the audio clip. The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Audio clip of a conversation claiming that Government of India will announce shutdown of the country in the coming days from 15 April to 15 June in the wake of Coronavirus outbreak.Fact: PIB debunked the audio clip of the phone conversation discussing \u2018complete lockdown\u2019 of the country from 15 April to 15 June as \u2018fake\u2019. WHO India has also confirmed that the audio is fake. So, the claim is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 During the conversation in that purported phone call, a person who claims to be a friend of a brother of World Health Organization India Director says that WHO has instructed the Indian Government to announce Section 144 in two of the Rajasthan cities \u2013 Jaipur and Udaipur. He continues to say that the WHO\u2019s instruction was to shut the movie theatres, malls till April 15 but the Government has said that, at once, if the shutdown is put in place to such an extent, then people will get panicked and so it issued orders for the shutdown of movie theatres and malls only till 31 March. The person then says that as the number of Coronavirus cases in India is rising, the country is moving to high risk and there would be a complete shut down in the country from 15 April to 15 June except for Police and hospitals. He then advises the person on the other side of the call to hoard the stocks of food and medicines for the coming one and a half months to two months to meet the needs during the shutdown.When searched on Google to check if the Government of India is going to announce any such shutdown of the country from 15 April to 15 June in the wake of Coronavirus outbreak, a facebook post by \u2018PIB\u2019 in this regard was found. In the post, \u2018PIB\u2019 has debunked the message in the audio clip and clarified that the audio clip claiming to be a conversation between two individuals mentioning the \u2018complete lockdown\u2019 of the country as \u2018totally fake\u2019. In a conversation with Prasar Bharati News Services, World Health Organization, India has termed the audio as completely fake and that the audio falsely attributes such statements to WHO Director in India.

So, the video is an old one and the claim is FALSE.The first Coronavirus case in the world was registered in China in December 2019.Through reverse image search, the video was found to have existed on the internet at least since July 2018. The video was first posted on Twitter and it was found that the Muslims in the video belonged to \u2018Bohra\u2019 community and they were doing so in the video to not waste food. When searched on Google with specific keywords, the same video was found on \u2018Vimeo\u2019. The description in this video also had the same information about that video.\u00a0Bohras eat together in a big \u201cthaal\u201d. This one is from a jamatkhana where on several occasions there is food served. What\u2019s happening here is taking not wasting food at an extreme level. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 https://t.co/irxJePHlZ3\u2014 Yusuf Unjhawala \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 (@YusufDFI) July 30, 2018 When searched for more information about the \u2018Bohra\u2019 community, an article of news agency \u2013 \u2018The National\u2019 was found. As per this video, the entire Bohra family eats in a single plate \u2018Thaal\u2019 and they have \u2018no-wastage\u2019 policy. So, they do not leave a single grain of rice on their plate when it is taken away. Also, Bohra men are easy to identify as they put white topis (head caps) with golden embroidery. \u00a0When the head caps of the persons in the video are compared with the head caps worn by Bohra Muslims, they were found to be similar. So, the Muslims in the video belong to Bohra Community and they are licking plates and spoons to not waste food.To sum it up, an old video of Bohra Muslims licking plates and spoons to have the leftover food is being shared as \u2018Muslims spreading coronavirus disease\u2019.Did you watch our new video?

This is a group,that eat last, after all depart, they serve people. After everyone eats and goes they eat left overs and do not waste a single grain of rice. The foolish person licking spoons is over doing it. Imbecile. It is video which is two years old. This community has some enemies who have made it go viral. These people are safe. U can learn about dawoodi bohras.  \u091c\u0917\u0926\u0940\u092a \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939 \u0915\u0947 \u0915\u0921\u093c\u0935\u0947 \u092c\u094b\u0932 on  April 1, 2020 6:13 pm  \u0939\u092e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u092c \u092f\u0947 \u0926\u093e\u0935\u093e \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0915\u093f \u092f\u0947 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u092a\u0941\u0930\u093e\u0928\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0939\u092e\u0928\u0947 \u0907\u0938 \u092a\u0930\u0902\u092a\u0930\u093e \u0915\u093e \u0939\u0935\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0915\u0930 \u091c\u0928\u0924\u093e \u0915\u094b \u091c\u093e\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0915 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u093e \u0915\u093e\u092e \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u093f \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u0915\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0907\u0938 \u092d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u0915\u200c \u0926\u094c\u0930 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u0940 \u0907\u0938 \u092a\u0930\u0902\u092a\u0930\u093e \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928 \u0938\u093e\u092b \u0915\u093f\u092f\u0947 \u0917\u092f\u0947 \u0939\u094b\u0917\u0947\u0902 \u0924\u094b \u0915\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0915\u093e \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u094b\u092a \u0915\u094b\u0924\u0928\u093e \u092c\u0922\u093c \u0938\u0915\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964\u0907\u0938 \u0935\u0940\u0921\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0915\u093e \u091c\u0928\u0924\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0928\u0947 \u0906\u0928\u093e \u0909\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u0930\u094b\u0928\u093e \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f \u091c\u093e\u0917\u0930\u0941\u0915 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u0939\u093e\u092f\u0915 \u0938\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u0939\u094b\u0917\u093e\u0964  Rupesh sain on  April 1, 2020 6:58 pm  You are illogical see the people are applying their saliva on the plates not licking up the every grain of rice  Rahul on  April 1, 2020 10:54 pm  If so then why peoples applied there saliva on the back side of the plates.

Let\u2019s analyze the claim about the video.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim:  Video of the new hospital set up by China for Coronavirus patients.Fact: The video is found to exist on the internet at least since 2018. So, the claim that it shows the new hospital set up by China for Coronavirus patients is FALSE.From the \u2018Business Insider\u2019 article, it can be learnt that China has constructed an emergency hospital for Coronavirus patients to tackle the virus outbreak. But, it does not consist of 57 floors.In the post, it is mentioned, the new hospital is of 57 floors and was constructed in 19 days. So, when searched on YouTube with the keywords \u201857 floors hospital constructed in 19 days\u2019, many search results were obtained. In the search results, the same video was found. It has been uploaded by a user in May 2018. But, no more information was found from it.A search result of \u2018The Guardian\u2019 had similar visuals as seen in the viral video and had the timestamp \u2013 \u201930 April 2015\u2032. The visuals between -1:37 and -1:27 in the viral video can be seen in that video during 0:00 and 0:19. The video shows the construction of a 57-storey skyscraper in 19 days in Changsha, Hunan Province (China). The visuals between -0:47 and -0:40 in the viral video can be seen in a 2011 video (0:25 to 0:32) that shows the construction of a 6-storey building in 5 days. So, the video in the post is a combination of many videos.The video of the emergency hospital constructed in China for Coronavirus patients can be seen here.

The two ways are: \u201c1. Colored side out if you\u2019re sick and do not want to spread your germs around. 2. White side out (this is the filter part) for when you\u2019re not sick and you want to stop germs from getting in\u201d. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim:  Two ways of wearing a surgical mask: Colored side out if you are sick and White side out if you do not want to become sick.Fact: There is only one way of wearing a three-layered surgical mask. The colored side of the surgical mask should face outwards. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.When searched regarding the ways of wearing a surgical mask, no information was found regarding the ways mentioned in the post. In an article published by \u2018The Strait Times\u2019, in September-2019, it can be read that \u2018there is only one way to wear the good quality surgical masks that most people are familiar with \u2013 with the colored side facing outwards\u2019. Also, in the document released by the \u2018Centre for Health Protection\u2019, it can be read that, \u2018in general, the colored side/the side with folds facing downwards of the surgical mask should face outwards with the metallic strip uppermost\u2019.Also, a similar suggestion can be seen in the \u2018wiki How\u2019 article on \u2018How to Put on a Medical Mask\u2019.Some videos by the experts on how to wear the surgical mask can be watched here and here. The Health Promotion Board of Singapore also released posters on its Facebook page explaining how to wear a mask.To sum it up, there is only one way to wear a three-layered surgical mask: Colored-side outwards.Did you watch our new video in the DECODE series?

The inmates of the Katzbach concentration camp, a part of the former Adler industrial factory, were forced into a death march to the concentration camps of Buchenwald and Dachau on March 24, 1945. Some 528 victims of Katzbach are buried at Frankfurt\u2019s central cemetery\u2019.

The audio clip claims that Modi went to the US and has brought medicines, which will be only given to selected people in the name of vaccines for coronavirus. It is also being claimed that people who will be given these medicines will die. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. Claim: Photos of medicines from the US which will be only given to selected people by the Indian government in the name of COVID-19 treatment to eliminate them.Fact: The photos are neither related to India nor the US. The photos were taken at Kota Kinabalu International Airport (Sabha, Malaysia) when the health equipment donated by the Chinese Government reached the airport. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0 \u00a0When the photos were run through the Google Reverse Image, all the four photos were found in a post on Facebook. The photos were posted by Shafie Apdal, the Chief Minister of Sabha state (Malaysia). He posted the same photos (and many other photos) and thanked the Chinese government for the donation of health equipment to fight COVID-19 in the State. The photos were taken at Kota Kinabalu International Airport (Sabha, Malaysia). The photos are neither related to India nor the US. Also, there was no mention of any medicine or vaccine in his post. More information regarding China\u2019s donation to Sabha state can be read here, here and here.To sum it up, unrelated photos and an audio clip falsely shared as \u2018Medicines from the US to be given to selected people in India for eliminating them\u2019.Did you watch our new video?

Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of Police killing COVID-19 affected people in China.Fact: The posted video was edited with three unrelated clips to falsely claim that Police with arms are killing people. The Yiwu Police have clarified that the armed Police in the video were on their duty to kill a rabid dog. And, the last clip is related to an accident. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.The number \u2018G1796\u2019 can be seen on the Police car. So, when searched with the keyword \u2013 \u2018G1796\u2019 on Google, an article by \u2018CGTN\u2019 was found in the search results. In the article, the clarification given by the Yiwu Police Bureau regarding the video can be seen. The Police said \u2013 \u2018At 11:37 a.m. on February 1, Yiwu Police received a report from civilians asking for help to handle a ravenous dog, which had been hurting people in Futian neighbourhood. The policemen shot the dog after evaluating the danger it imposed on humans\u2019.In the video, there are three different clips. The Yiwu Police have said that the first clip is relevant to them and it is not related to the other two clips show in the video. While no credible information was found about the second clip, it was found that the third clip in the video is related to a road accident in China. In a video uploaded by \u2018CGTN\u2019 on YouTube, the Wuzu Police official, showing the accident location, explains that \u2018a 15-year-old Liu took his cousin on the motorcycle and due to wrong operation, the vehicle rammed into the cemented curb in the afternoon on January 29\u2019. The statements of the Doctor and Liu\u2019s cousin, regarding the accident, can be also watched in the video. The accident video was also fact-checked by \u2018France 24\u2019 previously.To sum it up, three unrelated clips joined to falsely claim that Police are killing COVID-19 affected people in China.Did you watch our new video in the DECODE series?

Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Kerala has asked NABARD for a loan of Rs 20,000 crore to deal with COVID-19.Fact: While it is true that the Kerala Government has announced a financial package of Rs. 20,000 crore to fight the pandemic, they have not asked NABARD for a loan of Rs 20,000 crore. They have requested for a special line of credit of Rs 2000 crore from NABARD under RIDF. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 On the official Twitter handle of Kerala Chief Minister\u2019s Office, it can be found that the Kerala Government has announced a special package of Rs. 20,000 crore to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.Kerala Govt's Special Package | #COVID1920,000 Cr financial package to fight the pandemic. \u2705 Loans worth 2000 Cr through Kudumbashree \u2705 2000 Cr for employment guarantee programme \u2705 2 months welfare pensions in advance\u2705 500 Cr health package\u2014 CMO Kerala (@CMOKerala) March 19, 2020 In the post, \u2018The News Minute\u2019 article was given. So, when searched with the keywords, \u2018The News Minute\u2019 article related to the NABARD loan was found. While the title shows \u2019loan of Rs 20,000 crore\u2019 in the Google search results, the article (when opened) shows \u2019loan of Rs 2,000 crore\u2019. So, on looking at the cached version of the article, it was found that the title of the article was updated. The archived cache version of the original article can be found here. Also, Dhanya Rajendran (Editor-in-Chief of \u2018The News Minute\u2019) has tweeted that it was a typing mistake. So, the Kerala Government has not asked NABARD for a loan of Rs 20,000 crore.Also, in the letter sent by Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan to Chairman of NABARD, it can be read that the Kerala Government has requested \u2018a special line of credit of Rs. 2000 Crore under Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) for Kerala State at 2 per cent per year, 190 bases points less than the prevailing 3.9 per cent per annum\u2019.To sum it up, the Kerala Government has asked NABARD for a loan of Rs 2,000 crore, not Rs 20,000 crore.Did you watch our new video?

Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: COVID-19 patients will not show symptoms for the first 14 days.Fact: On the WHO website, it can be read that the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days. But, most commonly COVID-19 patients show symptoms in around five days. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.When searched about the incubation period (i.e. the time between contracting the virus and showing symptoms of the disease) for COVID-19, on the WHO website, it can be read that \u2018most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days\u2019.Also, talking to CALTECH community members, David Ho (a Caltech trustee and an expert on viral epidemics) has said, \u2018The incubation period from exposure to onset of symptoms is between four and six days; and if you want to cover 95\u201398 percent of the cases it is between three and 10 days. It\u2019s pretty rare to have an incubation period outside of that range\u2019. A similar timeframe was also found in a study led by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.To sum it up, it is very rare for COVID-19 patients to show symptoms after 14 days.

In the message, it is being claimed that, as Coronavirus enters through a person\u2019s nose, if mustard oil is applied inside both the nostrils before bathing in the morning, it will protect him for at least eight hours from the virus. Also, the message claims that mustard oil is an anti-virus oil and using it will cause the virus to stick to the walls of the nose and then, it kills the virus by preventing it from reaching a person\u2019s lungs, thus protecting him from getting infected. Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the message in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Mustard oil prevents a person from getting infected with COVID-19.Fact: Neither World Health Organization (WHO) nor the Ministry for Health & Family Welfare (India) has announced that using mustard oil can prevent a person from getting infected with COVID-19.

As the message went viral on social media, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has\u00a0debunked\u00a0the claim and clarified that mustard oil cannot kill Coronavirus. It also said that, as of now, there is no treatment for Coronavirus and no type of oil can destroy it. So, mustard oil cannot prevent a person from getting infected with Coronavirus.During the search process, it was\u00a0found that mustard oil has many health benefits. However, it is not a cure for coronavirus.

The message reads, \u2018As carona virus life at one place is 12 hrs and Janta curfew is for 14 hrs so the places or points of public areas where carona may have survived will not be touched for 14 hrs and this will break the chain. What we get after 14 hrs will be a safer country\u2019. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Coronavirus can live only up to 12 hours on any surface.Fact: According to a scientific study, Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was stable on some surfaces (like plastic and stainless steel) for up to 72 hours (3 days). Also, on the WHO website, it can be read that virus \u2018may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days\u2019. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 When searched about the survival period of Coronavirus on different surfaces, an article regarding a study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA and Princeton University was found on the \u2018The New England Journal of Medicine\u2019 website. The study evaluated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) (previously called \u2018HCoV-19\u2019) and SARS-CoV-1 (which infected more than 8,000 people in 2002 and 2003) in aerosols and on various surfaces and estimated their decay rates. (\u2018For surfaces, viruses were applied on copper, cardboard, steel and plastic maintained at 21-23\u00b0C and 40% RH over seven days.\u2019)In the study, it can be read that \u2018SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, and viable virus was detected up to 72 hours after application to these surfaces\u2019. According to the study conducted by the scientists, the time period for which the virus remained infectious on some surfaces can be seen in the picture below:On the WHO website, it can be read that \u2018it is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days\u2019. An analysis of earlier studies on similar coronaviruses can be read here.Some prominent news agencies have also published articles, quoting the same study, that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be stable on some surfaces up to 72 hours, which can be read here and here. A study has found that \u2018the arrival of summer (high temperature) and rainy season (high humidity) in the northern hemisphere may be able to reduce the transmission of the COVID-19\u2019.To sum it up, Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be stable on some surfaces (like plastic and stainless steel) for up to 72 hours (3 days).Update: Press Information Bureau (PIB) has clarified that \u2018There is no evidence to prove that the life of Coronavirus is of 12 hours\u2019.There is NO EVIDENCE to prove that #Coronavirus survives only for 12 hours.Everyone is advised to follow #socialdistancing even after #JantaCurfew pic.twitter.com/oHnn70HLtO\u2014 PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) March 22, 2020 Did you watch our new video?

The post criticizes PM Modi for allowing such a congregation in his Home State (Gujarat) despite the current lockdown in the country. Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Photos of grandcelebration of Ram Navami (on 2 April 2020) at Bhuj Mandir in Gujarat during LockdownFact: The photos are related to \u2018153rd Patotsav of Shree Harikrushna Maharaj\u2019 celebrations at Bhuj Mandir. The celebrations were held from 21 February 2020 to 25 February 2020, i.e. before the lockdown. The posted photos are the screenshots of a video which was streamed live on 22 February 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0 \u00a0Some users have posted (archived) on Facebook claiming that the photos are the screenshots of the video posted recently (in April 2020) by the official YouTube Channel of \u2018Bhuj Mandir\u2019. The video can be found here. In the video description, it can be read that the video is related to \u2018Harikrushna Maharaj Patotsav 2020\u2019.But, on the official website, it was found that \u2018153rd Patotsav of Shree Harikrushna Maharaj\u2019 celebrations were held from 21 February 2020 to 25 February 2020 at Bhuj Mandir.So, when searched on its YouTube channel, it was found that the recent video uploaded in April 2020 is a shorter version of the video streamed live on 22 February 2020. So, the posted photos are actually the screenshots of the live video from February 2020 i.e. before the lockdown was imposed. Also, the photos of the event can be found on the official website.To sum it up, old photos are falsely shared as \u2018Photos of Ram Navami celebrations at Bhuj Mandir (Gujarat) during the current lockdown period.Did you watch our new video?

Let\u2019s check the authenticity of the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued an order that sharing post about coronavirus on social media groups a punishable offence.Fact: Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has not declared that posting anything related to coronavirus on social media is a punishable offence. Also, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has clarified that the Ministry of Home Affairs hasn\u2019t issued any such order. So, the claim is FALSE.When searched if the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has issued any such order, information from no credible sources was found confirming it. In the Facebook post, the message is said to be issued by Ravi Nayak, Principal Secretary \u2013 Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). But, in the office directory of the Ministry, there is no person with the name \u2018Ravi Nayak\u2019 and there is no designation called Principal Secretary.Also, as the message went viral, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has debunked the claim and clarified that the Ministry of Home Affairs hasn\u2019t issued any such order.

Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post.Claim: People shouting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 in Europe after the Coronavirus outbreak.Fact: The video is not related to COVID-19 outbreak in Europe. The video was found to be on the internet since 13 January 2020, whereas the first COVID-19 case in Europe was reported on 24 January 2020. The video was taken in Germany, where the first COVID-19 case was reported on 28 January 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 When the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same video was found in the search results. The video was found to be uploaded on YouTube on 13 January 2020. It has the description that the video was taken in Hamburg (Germany). But, the first COVID-19 case was reported in Germany on 28 January 2020 (first COVID-19 case in Europe was reported on 24 January 2020). So, it was not taken after the outbreak of Coronavirus in Europe.When searched about the procession in Hamburg in January, some pictures with similar visuals were found on the \u2018Getty Images\u2019 website. On the website, it can be read that people in Hamburg demonstrated, on 11 January 2020, against the oppression of the Uyghur Muslim minority in China. While the location of the demonstration looks the same from the pictures, it cannot be concluded that the video is related to the same demonstration. But the video was definitely taken before the Coronavirus outbreak.To sum it up, an old video falsely shared as \u2018people shouting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 in Europe after the Coronavirus outbreak\u2019.Did you watch our new video?

Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.\u00a0\u00a0 In the Press Release, it can be seen that the helpline number is given as \u201803-8888 2010\u2019. So, when searched for that number on Google, it was found in \u2018The Star\u2019 news article that the number was set up as a special hotline by the Malaysian Government \u2018to address questions and complaints by the public on any issues relating to the movement control order, which was imposed due to the Covid-19 outbreak\u2019.

Let\u2019s try to analyze the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: PM Modi has announced the extension of the All-India Lockdown till 4 May 2020.Fact: No such announcement has been made by PM Modi or the government. The posted India Today screenshot is a photoshopped version of the original telecast of Modi\u2019s address to the nation on 24 March 2020, where he announced the 21-day lockdown from 25 March 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.When searched for the news about the extension, it was found that no such extension has been announced by PM Modi or the government. Nothing about such an extension to the current lockdown can be found on the official Twitter handles of PM Narendra Modi and PMO India. Also, the posted image of India Today telecast is a photoshopped version of the original telecast of Modi\u2019s address to the nation on 24 March 2020, where he announced the 21-day lockdown from 25 March 2020.

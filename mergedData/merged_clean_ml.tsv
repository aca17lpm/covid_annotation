There is no evidence to suggest that gargling salt water or vinegar, or partaking in many other home remedies, fight SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Based on the evidence, AAP FactCheck found the post to contain a mixture of true and false claims. A runny nose, sputum, dry cough and pneumonia can be symptoms of COVID-19 however not everyone infected with the disease will have them. Disease expert Prof Collignon says temperatures around 26 to 27 degrees C won't kill the virus however UV light from the sun can be effective in drying out the virus. Understanding of how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces is limited, with the WHO referring to previous studies of other viruses to estimate a range of a few hours to a few days. Drinking warm water, avoiding iced drinks and gargling warm salt water are not treatments or preventions, according to Prof Cunningham, however staying hydrated is important and gargling may relieve sore throats. The timeline for progression of COVID-19 symptoms is partly accurate but not everyone will experience all of these symptoms or in that order. Prof Cunningham also said it was not accurate to say infection will happen first in the throat, as the delicate tissues behind the nose are more likely starting points.	Vacc	Vacc	7	18

There are several conspiracy narratives developed in the report, including on US Labs artificially linked to the coronavirus. In the context of conspiracy narrative, the story author names Tbilisi-based Lugar Laboratory of biological research, making an unreasonable parallel between virus found in China and Tbilisi Laboratory. Moreover, the story features the archive material from 2018, in which former Georgian Minister of Security Igor Giorgadze talks about the threats coming from the Lugar Lab. Lugar Laboratory is a part of the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health of Ministry of Health of Georgia. For years, Lugar Lab has been a target of Kremlin, Russia affiliated media, Russian politicians and high officials. Except for US-financed C Hepatitis Treatment program, there are other conspiracies linked to the lab.	Consp	Consp	9	22

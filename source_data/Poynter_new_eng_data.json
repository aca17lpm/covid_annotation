The claim with the video is that the Kenyan government is using Maasai tribe men to carry out stricter measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus in the country. Let’s analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found hereClaim: Video of the Kenya Government using a Maasai tribe man to impose social distancing in Kenya.Fact: The video is made by an ‘Entertainment’ based YouTube channel ‘Mbuzi Seller’. It doesn’t show a real-life incident. Also, there are no reports about the Kenyan government roping in Maasai tribe men to carry out stricter actions in the wake of Coronavirus infections in the country. So, the claim is FALSE.   The video in the post has the text ‘Mbuzziseller’ on it. So, when searched with that text, a YouTube channel with the same name was found in the results. In that channel, a longer version of the same video was found. When one goes through the video carefully, it can be found that the video was shot for ‘Entertainment’ purposes. In the description of the video, ‘#Tanzania comedy’ can be seen. When one goes through the other videos of that YouTube channel, the man can be seen in the same attire as in the video posted.Also, when searched if the Kenyan government roped in Maasai tribe men to carry out stricter actions, no reports were found. When the video went viral, a news website ‘kenyans.co.ke’ has debunked the claim, which can be seen here. To conclude, a video made by an ‘Entertainment’ based YouTube channel is being shared as ‘Kenyan government using Maasai tribe men for carrying out stricter measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus’.Did you watch our new video?

The worst part is all are Muslims and ROAMING freely with chappal inside the temple’. Let’s analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found hereClaim: The Government of Andhra Pradesh has made Kanipakam temple a quarantine center for coronavirus suspects.Fact: The building in the video is not Kanipakam temple, it is a pilgrim lodge (‘Sri Ganesh Sadan’) in Kanipakam that is being used as a quarantine center by the Andhra Pradesh government. So, the claim made in the post is FALSE.   When one goes through the video carefully, a board with the name ‘Sri Ganesh Sadan’ can be seen on the building. So, when searched on Google with the text ‘Sri Ganesh Sadan Kanipakam’, a pilgrim lodge is found to exist with that name in Kanipakam. When one goes through the photos of that lodge, the building in the video can be seen. So, it is not a temple as claimed in the post. As it is a lodge, people can be seen wearing footwear in Google photos too.An article of ‘Eenadu’ with the news that ‘Sri Ganesh Sadan’ will be used as a quarantine center in Kanipakam can be read here.To summarize, the quarantine center seen in the video is not Kanipakam ‘temple’; it’s a ‘pilgrim lodge’ in Kanipakam.Did you watch our new video?

So, the video has nothing to do with the spreading of Coronavirus.Sources:Claim – Facebook post (archived)Fact – https://nypost.com/2019/08/02/man-quickly-finds-out-he-spit-on-the-wrong-subway-riders-face/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7317359/Straphanger-mercilessly-beats-passenger-unconscious-stranger-SPITS-face.htmlhttps://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0121-novel-coronavirus-travel-case.htmlDid you watch our new video?

Earlier, PM Modi had appealed to people to switch off lights at 9 PM for 9 mins on 05 April & light candle, ‘Diya’ or mobile’s flashlight, to mark fight against COVID-19. Let’s analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of a fire accident that took place at the Solapur Airport on 05 April 2020.Fact: A fire accident took place at the Solapur Airport as a result of the bursting of crackers on 05 April 2020, but the video is not related to that accident. It is that of the fire accident that took place at the Solapur Airport on 03 February 2020. So, the claim is MISLEADING.   On reverse image search of the screenshots from the video, a news video of ‘ABP Majha’ was obtained in the search results. It had the same visuals as that of the video posted and is found to be of the fire accident at the Solapur Airport on 03 February 2020. As per a news report, a fire broke out at the Solapur Airport at 7 PM on 03 February 2020 and the fire officials have brought the fire under control by dousing it. The article mentioned that the exact reason for the fire accident was yet to be ascertained.As per the article of ‘The New Indian Express’, an official of Solapur Airport has said that a minor fire broke out at the airport on 05 April 2020. Prima facie, it is believed that the firecrackers burst by some people while responding to PM Modi’s call to switch off lights at 9 pm might be the reason. Airports Authority of India (AAI) has also put out a tweet regarding the accident and clarified that there was no damage to the property due to the accident and also it hasn’t affected the airport operations. Alert Airport Fire Safety Team, Solapur Airport along with City Fire Brigade extinguished the sudden grass fire that broke out in the operational area of the airport yesterday night. No damage caused to the airport property and no adverse impact on airport operations. #AAI— Airports Authority of India (@AAI_Official) April 6, 2020 To conclude, an old video shared as recent fire accident at the Solapur Airport on 05 April 2020Did you watch our new video?

The post criticizes PM Modi for allowing such a congregation in his Home State (Gujarat) despite the current lockdown in the country. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Photos of grandcelebration of Ram Navami (on 2 April 2020) at Bhuj Mandir in Gujarat during LockdownFact: The photos are related to ‘153rd Patotsav of Shree Harikrushna Maharaj’ celebrations at Bhuj Mandir. The celebrations were held from 21 February 2020 to 25 February 2020, i.e. before the lockdown. The posted photos are the screenshots of a video which was streamed live on 22 February 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   Some users have posted (archived) on Facebook claiming that the photos are the screenshots of the video posted recently (in April 2020) by the official YouTube Channel of ‘Bhuj Mandir’. The video can be found here. In the video description, it can be read that the video is related to ‘Harikrushna Maharaj Patotsav 2020’.But, on the official website, it was found that ‘153rd Patotsav of Shree Harikrushna Maharaj’ celebrations were held from 21 February 2020 to 25 February 2020 at Bhuj Mandir.So, when searched on its YouTube channel, it was found that the recent video uploaded in April 2020 is a shorter version of the video streamed live on 22 February 2020. So, the posted photos are actually the screenshots of the live video from February 2020 i.e. before the lockdown was imposed. Also, the photos of the event can be found on the official website.To sum it up, old photos are falsely shared as ‘Photos of Ram Navami celebrations at Bhuj Mandir (Gujarat) during the current lockdown period.Did you watch our new video?

Let’s analyze the claim about the video.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: : Video of Muslims gathered on roads despite the curfew to curb the spread of Coronavirus.Fact: The video is from Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and was taken in December 2019. So, the video is of an incident that took place prior to the announcement of lockdown in Gujarat. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.When screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, it was found that the video is from Ahmedabad (Gujarat) and was taken in December 2019. It shows the violence that erupted during the anti-CAA protests in Shah-e-Alam area wherein the protestors pelted stones on several Police vans. So, the video is of an incident that took place prior to the introduction of lockdown in Gujarat to curb the spread of Coronavirus. When the video has earlier gone viral with another claim, FACTLY has debunked it and has written a fact-check article on it.To conclude, an old video is being shared as ‘Muslims gathered on roads despite the existing curfew’.   Did you watch our new video?

Let’s check the authenticity of the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of Muslims applying their saliva to plates and spoons to spread the coronavirus disease.Fact: The first Coronavirus case in the world was registered in December 2019. But the video is found to exist on social media at least since July 2018. So, the video is an old one and the claim is FALSE.The first Coronavirus case in the world was registered in China in December 2019.Through reverse image search, the video was found to have existed on the internet at least since July 2018. The video was first posted on Twitter and it was found that the Muslims in the video belonged to ‘Bohra’ community and they were doing so in the video to not waste food. When searched on Google with specific keywords, the same video was found on ‘Vimeo’. The description in this video also had the same information about that video. Bohras eat together in a big “thaal”. This one is from a jamatkhana where on several occasions there is food served. What’s happening here is taking not wasting food at an extreme level. 🤣🤣 https://t.co/irxJePHlZ3— Yusuf Unjhawala 🇮🇳 (@YusufDFI) July 30, 2018 When searched for more information about the ‘Bohra’ community, an article of news agency – ‘The National’ was found. As per this video, the entire Bohra family eats in a single plate ‘Thaal’ and they have ‘no-wastage’ policy. So, they do not leave a single grain of rice on their plate when it is taken away. Also, Bohra men are easy to identify as they put white topis (head caps) with golden embroidery.  When the head caps of the persons in the video are compared with the head caps worn by Bohra Muslims, they were found to be similar. So, the Muslims in the video belong to Bohra Community and they are licking plates and spoons to not waste food.To sum it up, an old video of Bohra Muslims licking plates and spoons to have the leftover food is being shared as ‘Muslims spreading coronavirus disease’.Did you watch our new video?

In the posted video, the news anchor reads out the Facebook posts put by various users, in which they criticize Sharukh Khan for the donation and goes on to tell that Sharukh hasn’t made any donation to any mishaps or accidents in India. Let’s try to analyze the authenticity of the video.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: India TV telecasted news that Bollywood Actor Shahrukh Khan donated 45 Crore Rupees to Pakistan Oil tanker blast victims.Fact: The video is a clipped version of India TV’s fact-check video. In the original fact-check video, India TV has debunked the same claim and concluded that Shahrukh has not made any donation to Pakistan Oil tanker blast victims. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.When searched with the keywords shown in the video, the full version of the video was found on the YouTube channel of ‘India TV’. In the video, the channel has fact-checked posts on social media that went viral in 2017 claiming that Shahrukh Khan has donated 45 Crore Rupees to the victims of Pakistan Oil tanker blast. The channel debunked the claim and concluded that Sharukh Khan’s Media Team has clarified to them that such news is baseless and Sharukh Khan hasn’t made any donation to the victims of Pakistan Oil tanker blast. In the Fact-check video, the news reporter has also read out the instances in the past when Sharukh Khan took up charitable activities in India and made donations to the victims of natural disasters in the country.On 25 June 2017, an Oil tanker has overturned and exploded at Bahawalpur in Pakistan, leading to the death of more than 150 people. More information about the accident can be read here.To sum it up, India TV’s fact-check video was clipped to falsely claim that Sharukh Khan has donated 45 Crore Rupees to Pakistan Oil tanker blast victims.

Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Press Release on movement restriction for COVID-19 outbreak by National Security Council, PMO (India).Fact: The press release in the post was issued by the Malaysian Government, not by the Indian Government. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   In the Press Release, it can be seen that the helpline number is given as ‘03-8888 2010’. So, when searched for that number on Google, it was found in ‘The Star’ news article that the number was set up as a special hotline by the Malaysian Government ‘to address questions and complaints by the public on any issues relating to the movement control order, which was imposed due to the Covid-19 outbreak’. The same number can be also seen in a tweet by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry – Malaysia (‘MITI Malaysia’).Warta membenarkan pengeluaran kilang2 penting utk disambung semula dengan kadar minimum adalah olh Kerajaan dan peranan kami adalah utk memproses permohonan.Sekiranya anda mempunyai sebarang pertanyaan atau aduan mengenai perkara ini bolehlah diajukan ketalian MKN di 03-8888 2010— MITI Malaysia (@MITIMalaysia) March 19, 2020 The same press release can be also found on the PMO-Malaysia website. So, the press release was not issued by the Indian Government.A lot of people are sharing the document on social media claiming that it was released by the Indian Government. If one looks at carefully, there are many clues in the document which suggest that it was not issued by the Indian Government. Some of those clues can be found in the picture below: No such regulations as mentioned in the press release exist in IndiaPolice & Department volunteers in Malaysia are called PDRM and there is no such thing in India.The phone number mentioned does not belong to IndiaBURSA is the Malaysian stock exchangeAlso, the Press Information Bureau of India and Prasar Bharati News Services has tweeted that ‘no such Press Release has been issued by PMO-India’.Claim: A Press Release regarding movement restriction is widely getting circulated on #WhatsApp claiming to be of Government of India.#PIBFactCheck: No such Press Release has been issued by @PMOIndia. pic.twitter.com/6CQOJUhSpG— PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) March 19, 2020 To sum it up, the press release on movement restriction for the COVID-19 outbreak was issued by PMO-Malaysia, not PMO-India.Did you watch our new video?

Let’s try to find out the authenticity of the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Gargling warm water with either salt or vinegar can eliminate Coronavirus.Fact: The World Health Organisation (WHO) or Indian government has not mentioned anywhere that the gargling of warm water with salt or vinegar can eliminate coronavirus. Indian government’s Press Information Bureau (PIB) has also said that the message that was circulating on social media is fake. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.   When searched to find out if the usage of warm water with salt or vinegar can eliminate Coronavirus, no credible information from the World Health Organisation (WHO) or Indian government was found. Earlier, when the same message (gargling of warm water with salt can prevent the spread of coronavirus) was circulated, WHO has sent an email to ‘AFP‘ that they don’t have any concrete evidence to substantiate that news.According to the WHO, there is no vaccine to treat COVID-19 yet. From the information found on the National Institute of Health (NIH) website, an investigational vaccine (mRNA-1273) developed by a company is being tested in America. However, it takes time to find out if the vaccine is efficient enough to treat COVID-19. ‘PIB Fact Check’ has also tweeted that the above message that’s been circulating on social media is false. PIB is the official public information department of the central government.#Coronavirus CANNOT be treated by gargling with warm water mixed with salt and vinegar.This is #fakenews circulating on social media and WhatsApp.For authentic information on #Coronavirusoutbreak, follow @PIB_India and @MoHFW_INDIA #PIBFactCheck #IndiaFightsCorona pic.twitter.com/gKUGDBqR9Q— PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) March 16, 2020 The information about the protective measures advised by the WHO to prevent coronavirus can be found on their website.To sum it up, there is no proof that gargling with warm water and salt or vinegar can eliminate Coronavirus.Did you watch our new video?

There is no harm in consuming thoroughly cooked meat  0 By Anusha Rao  on  March 18, 2020    A A A    Twitter  Facebook  Reddit A post with a photo of goat’s meat with dark spots is being shared on Facebook with a claim that coronavirus was found in goat meat and it advises people not to consume meat. Let’s try to find the authenticity of the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Coronavirus was found in mutton.Fact: The photo in the post was edited. Also, the photo was taken five or six years ago. WHO and FSSAI have also mentioned that properly cooked meat can be consumed. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.   When the photo in the post was searched using Google reverse image technique, a ‘justdial’ link with the same photo was found in the search results. By comparing the two pictures, it can be noticed that the posted picture has more spots than the original photo. Furthermore, when ‘Khaja A1 – Mutton Shop’, who posted the original picture on the ‘justdial’ website was contacted by FACTLY it was found that the photo was uploaded around 5 or 6 years ago. But, coronavirus outbreak was first reported last year in December. So, the original photo on social media was edited and is being shared as if it is infected with coronavirus.The CEO of FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India), G.S.G. Iyengar has also mentioned that there is no scientific data till date to prove that the consumption of chicken, mutton and other non-vegetarian foods can cause the spread of coronavirus. Also, in the press release of FSSAI and in the WHO (World Health Organisation) website it can be seen that properly cooked meat is safe to eat.The minister of Dairy, animal husbandry and fisheries, Shandilya Giriraj Singh has also tweeted that the consumption of chicken, meat, fish and eggs doesn’t cause the transmission of Coronavirus.भ्रांतियों से सावधान:-मटन ,चिकन अण्डा और मछली खाने से कोरोना वाइरस का संक्रमण नहीं होता है! pic.twitter.com/Ai9S75AZO5— Shandilya Giriraj Singh (@girirajsinghbjp) March 12, 2020 Previously, when the message that chicken consumption causes coronavirus transmission went viral, FACTLY debunked it as Fake news and the article can be read here.To sum it up, the photo in the post was edited.

Let’s check the authenticity of the claim in the message.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) will be spraying medicine in the air after 10 PM tonight in order to kill COVID-19.Fact: The BBMP Commissioner and the Mayor have clarified that the message is just a rumor and the BBMP has no such plans to spray any medicine for COVID-19. So, the claim is FALSE.   On checking the Twitter account of BBMP Commissioner to know if BBMP is planning to spray any medicine for COVID-19 in Bengaluru city, a tweet by him on 18 March was found. In his tweet, B.H. Anil Kumar (Commissioner of BBMP) has said that the message is just a rumour and the BBMP has no plans to spray any medicine for COVID-19. The same can also be found in a tweet by BBMP Mayor M. Goutham Kumar. When a similar message went viral across the country saying that the Government of India will spray Coronavirus vaccine gas, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has debunked the claim and clarified that the Government is doing no such thing and the message is ‘fake’.Also, when a similar message went viral in Oman saying that the Government of Oman is spraying Coronavirus pesticide in the country to combat the spread of COVID-19, the Ministry of Health (Oman) has said that it is a rumour and no such operation is planned.To sum it up, the message that BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) will be spraying medicine in the air to kill COVID-19 is just a rumour.

Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of goats affected by Coronavirus.Fact: The video is an old one. It was taken before the recent Coronavirus outbreak. Also, the Minister for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries has clarified that there is no evidence to show that eating mutton can transmit Coronavirus. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   When the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same video was found in the search results. The video was found to be uploaded on YouTube on 12 December 2019. But the recent Coronavirus epidemic was reported to have begun in the last week of December 2019. So, the video is not related to the recent ‘SARS-CoV-2’ Coronavirus. When a similar video went viral in UAE, their government has clarified that ‘the footage is old’.Also, the Minister for Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, Shandilya Giriraj Singh has tweeted that the consumption of chicken, mutton, fish, and eggs doesn’t cause the transmission of Coronavirus.भ्रांतियों से सावधान:-मटन ,चिकन अण्डा और मछली खाने से कोरोना वाइरस का संक्रमण नहीं होता है! pic.twitter.com/Ai9S75AZO5— Shandilya Giriraj Singh (@girirajsinghbjp) March 12, 2020 Previously, when the message that chicken consumption causes coronavirus went viral, FACTLY debunked it as Fake news and the article can be read here.To sum it up, an old video falsely shared as ‘goats affected by Coronavirus’.Did you watch our new video?

During the conversation, a person who claims to be a friend of a brother of World Health Organization-India Director says that the Government of India will announce the shutdown of the country in the coming days from 15 April to 15 June. Let’s check the authenticity of the audio clip. The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Audio clip of a conversation claiming that Government of India will announce shutdown of the country in the coming days from 15 April to 15 June in the wake of Coronavirus outbreak.Fact: PIB debunked the audio clip of the phone conversation discussing ‘complete lockdown’ of the country from 15 April to 15 June as ‘fake’. WHO India has also confirmed that the audio is fake. So, the claim is FALSE.   During the conversation in that purported phone call, a person who claims to be a friend of a brother of World Health Organization India Director says that WHO has instructed the Indian Government to announce Section 144 in two of the Rajasthan cities – Jaipur and Udaipur. He continues to say that the WHO’s instruction was to shut the movie theatres, malls till April 15 but the Government has said that, at once, if the shutdown is put in place to such an extent, then people will get panicked and so it issued orders for the shutdown of movie theatres and malls only till 31 March. The person then says that as the number of Coronavirus cases in India is rising, the country is moving to high risk and there would be a complete shut down in the country from 15 April to 15 June except for Police and hospitals. He then advises the person on the other side of the call to hoard the stocks of food and medicines for the coming one and a half months to two months to meet the needs during the shutdown.When searched on Google to check if the Government of India is going to announce any such shutdown of the country from 15 April to 15 June in the wake of Coronavirus outbreak, a facebook post by ‘PIB’ in this regard was found. In the post, ‘PIB’ has debunked the message in the audio clip and clarified that the audio clip claiming to be a conversation between two individuals mentioning the ‘complete lockdown’ of the country as ‘totally fake’. In a conversation with Prasar Bharati News Services, World Health Organization, India has termed the audio as completely fake and that the audio falsely attributes such statements to WHO Director in India. WHO also clarified that it’s India wing is not headed by a woman, as claimed in the audio clip.Additionally, while the audio falsely attributes such statements to have come from WHO Director in India, WHO India has clarified, \"There is no such post in India.

Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.Claim: People shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’ in Europe after the Coronavirus outbreak.Fact: The video is not related to COVID-19 outbreak in Europe. The video was found to be on the internet since 13 January 2020, whereas the first COVID-19 case in Europe was reported on 24 January 2020. The video was taken in Germany, where the first COVID-19 case was reported on 28 January 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   When the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, the same video was found in the search results. The video was found to be uploaded on YouTube on 13 January 2020. It has the description that the video was taken in Hamburg (Germany). But, the first COVID-19 case was reported in Germany on 28 January 2020 (first COVID-19 case in Europe was reported on 24 January 2020). So, it was not taken after the outbreak of Coronavirus in Europe.When searched about the procession in Hamburg in January, some pictures with similar visuals were found on the ‘Getty Images’ website. On the website, it can be read that people in Hamburg demonstrated, on 11 January 2020, against the oppression of the Uyghur Muslim minority in China. While the location of the demonstration looks the same from the pictures, it cannot be concluded that the video is related to the same demonstration. But the video was definitely taken before the Coronavirus outbreak.To sum it up, an old video falsely shared as ‘people shouting ‘Allahu Akbar’ in Europe after the Coronavirus outbreak’.Did you watch our new video?

Let’s check the authenticity of the claim about the video. The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of Canada PM Justin Trudeau’s wife pleading people to take COVID-19 seriously.Fact: The woman in the video is not Canada Prime Minister’s wife (Sophie Grégoire Trudeau). She is Tara Jane Langston, a waitress who contracted COVID-19 and undergoing treatment at Hillingdon Hospital in London. So, the claim is FALSE.   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau was tested positive for Coronavirus and is in isolation since then.When the screenshots of the video were subjected to reverse image search, an article of ‘Dailymail’ was obtained in the search results.  As per this article, the woman in the video is Tara Jane Langston, a waitress who contracted COVID-19 and is undergoing treatment at Hillingdon Hospital in London. She has filmed the video in an intensive care unit of the hospital pleading people to take COVID-19 seriously. Tara Jane Langston was admitted to the hospital on 15 March and was later diagnosed with COVID-19. Since then, she is undergoing treatment and is now recovering well.Also, the same video is being falsely shared (archived post) as ‘Rita Bachkaniwala. First positive coronavirus case in Surat’.To conclude, the woman in the video is neither Canada PM’s wife nor belong to Surat.Did you watch our new video?   Share.

The message reads, ‘As carona virus life at one place is 12 hrs and Janta curfew is for 14 hrs so the places or points of public areas where carona may have survived will not be touched for 14 hrs and this will break the chain. What we get after 14 hrs will be a safer country’. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Coronavirus can live only up to 12 hours on any surface.Fact: According to a scientific study, Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was stable on some surfaces (like plastic and stainless steel) for up to 72 hours (3 days). Also, on the WHO website, it can be read that virus ‘may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days’. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   When searched about the survival period of Coronavirus on different surfaces, an article regarding a study conducted by scientists from the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA and Princeton University was found on the ‘The New England Journal of Medicine’ website. The study evaluated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) (previously called ‘HCoV-19’) and SARS-CoV-1 (which infected more than 8,000 people in 2002 and 2003) in aerosols and on various surfaces and estimated their decay rates. (‘For surfaces, viruses were applied on copper, cardboard, steel and plastic maintained at 21-23°C and 40% RH over seven days.’)In the study, it can be read that ‘SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, and viable virus was detected up to 72 hours after application to these surfaces’. According to the study conducted by the scientists, the time period for which the virus remained infectious on some surfaces can be seen in the picture below:On the WHO website, it can be read that ‘it is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days’. An analysis of earlier studies on similar coronaviruses can be read here.Some prominent news agencies have also published articles, quoting the same study, that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be stable on some surfaces up to 72 hours, which can be read here and here. A study has found that ‘the arrival of summer (high temperature) and rainy season (high humidity) in the northern hemisphere may be able to reduce the transmission of the COVID-19’.To sum it up, Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) can be stable on some surfaces (like plastic and stainless steel) for up to 72 hours (3 days).Update: Press Information Bureau (PIB) has clarified that ‘There is no evidence to prove that the life of Coronavirus is of 12 hours’.There is NO EVIDENCE to prove that #Coronavirus survives only for 12 hours.Everyone is advised to follow #socialdistancing even after #JantaCurfew pic.twitter.com/oHnn70HLtO— PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) March 22, 2020 Did you watch our new video?

Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: RBI extended the year closing till 30 June 2020.Fact: The normal financial year in India followed by the government & all other institutions including for taxation purpose is 01 April to 31 March. However, RBI’s accounting/financial year is from 1 July to 30 June. There is no change in the normal financial year. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   Financial Year in IndiaThe financial year followed by the Government of India, all other organizations, companies and for the purpose of taxation, book keeping is 01 April to 31 March. The financial year for all tax compliance is also April to March.This was adopted during the British regime. Multiple committees were set up in the past to revisit the fiscal year calendar. However, nothing has changed. In 2016, the government appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Shankar Acharya to examine the desirability and feasibility of having ‘a new financial year’. It was reported that the committee recommended changing to a January to December financial year. However, the government has not taken any decision on this till date.What about RBI?The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on the other hand follows a July to June financial year. On the RBI website, it can be seen that the financial year of RBI is July to June. The same can be also seen in its Annual report. However, it has to be noted that this financial year has no bearing on other institutions like banks, companies or even the government which follow the April to March financial year.What about the viral post on social media?In the post, a link to a newspaper article is given. In the article, it can be read that ‘fiscal 2019-20 will end on 30 June 2020 while fiscal year 2020-21 will begin on 1 July 2020 but ends on 31 March 2021’ in the case of RBI. The article does not claim that RBI extended its current financial year till 30 June 2020 because it is already till 30 June 2020. So, there is no extension as claimed in the postOn the RBI website, it can be found that in a meeting of the Central Board of Directors of Reserve Bank of India, on 15 February 2020, ‘the Board recommended aligning the financial year of RBI, currently July-June, with the Government’s fiscal year (April-March) from the year 2020-21 and approved forwarding a proposal to the Government for its consideration’. So, there is no change in the current financial year. To sum it up, RBI’s financial year is already from 1 July to 30 June. Changes were proposed from the next financial year. Moreover, there is no extension to the financial year followed by government, companies and other organizations for book keeping. Did you watch our new video?   Share.

Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Kerala has asked NABARD for a loan of Rs 20,000 crore to deal with COVID-19.Fact: While it is true that the Kerala Government has announced a financial package of Rs. 20,000 crore to fight the pandemic, they have not asked NABARD for a loan of Rs 20,000 crore. They have requested for a special line of credit of Rs 2000 crore from NABARD under RIDF. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   On the official Twitter handle of Kerala Chief Minister’s Office, it can be found that the Kerala Government has announced a special package of Rs. 20,000 crore to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.Kerala Govt's Special Package | #COVID1920,000 Cr financial package to fight the pandemic. ✅ Loans worth 2000 Cr through Kudumbashree ✅ 2000 Cr for employment guarantee programme ✅ 2 months welfare pensions in advance✅ 500 Cr health package— CMO Kerala (@CMOKerala) March 19, 2020 In the post, ‘The News Minute’ article was given. So, when searched with the keywords, ‘The News Minute’ article related to the NABARD loan was found. While the title shows ’loan of Rs 20,000 crore’ in the Google search results, the article (when opened) shows ’loan of Rs 2,000 crore’. So, on looking at the cached version of the article, it was found that the title of the article was updated. The archived cache version of the original article can be found here. Also, Dhanya Rajendran (Editor-in-Chief of ‘The News Minute’) has tweeted that it was a typing mistake. So, the Kerala Government has not asked NABARD for a loan of Rs 20,000 crore.Also, in the letter sent by Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan to Chairman of NABARD, it can be read that the Kerala Government has requested ‘a special line of credit of Rs. 2000 Crore under Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) for Kerala State at 2 per cent per year, 190 bases points less than the prevailing 3.9 per cent per annum’.To sum it up, the Kerala Government has asked NABARD for a loan of Rs 2,000 crore, not Rs 20,000 crore.Did you watch our new video?

While Modi has asked people to clap as a sign of gratitude to the various groups working to eradicate COVID-19, some people are posting that clapping will create vibrations which will then kill Coronavirus by making it lose all potency. Also, it is being claimed the event was planned on a Sunday (i.e. on 22 March 2020) as it is ‘Amavasya’ (New Moon Day). Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: There is science behind PM Modi’s 5 PM clapping initiative: Clapping generates vibration which can kill Coronavirus. Also, 22 March 2020 is Amavasya.Fact: There is no scientific evidence to prove that vibration from clapping hands can kill Coronavirus. The Press Information Bureau of India has clarified that the message is fake. Also, Amavasya is not on 22 March 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   Astrological Claim:First, let’s check whether Amavasya is on 22 March 2020. It was found on the internet that ‘Amavasya’ is from 23 March 220 (12:30 PM) – 24 March 2020 (02:58 PM), not on 22 March 2020. So, the theory that ‘22nd March is Amavasya, darkest day in a month. All virus, bacteria and evil forces have maximum potential and power on such days’ will not apply to 22 March 2020 as it is not Amavasya. Also, Revathi Nakshatra is from 25 March 2020 (04:19 AM) – Mar 26 March 2020 (07:16 AM). Similar dates (Amavasya on 24 March 2020 and Revathi Nakshatra on 25 March 2020) can be also found on the ‘Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams’ website. So, the astrological significance mentioned in the post is false.Scientific Evidence: Now, let’s check whether there is any scientific evidence to prove that clapping can kill Coronavirus. From various articles on the internet, it is found that ultrasound and laser pulses are being tested around the world to kill bacteria, viruses, and cancer cells. But no concrete evidence was found to prove that the vibration created from clapping hands can kill Coronavirus. If vibration from clapping hands could kill virus then WHO would have suggested the same. But no such preventive guidance can be found on the WHO website. Also, as the message went viral, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has clarified that ‘the vibration generated by clapping together will not destroy Coronavirus infection’.NO !

In the message, it is being claimed that, as Coronavirus enters through a person’s nose, if mustard oil is applied inside both the nostrils before bathing in the morning, it will protect him for at least eight hours from the virus. Also, the message claims that mustard oil is an anti-virus oil and using it will cause the virus to stick to the walls of the nose and then, it kills the virus by preventing it from reaching a person’s lungs, thus protecting him from getting infected. Let’s check the authenticity of the message in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Mustard oil prevents a person from getting infected with COVID-19.Fact: Neither World Health Organization (WHO) nor the Ministry for Health & Family Welfare (India) has announced that using mustard oil can prevent a person from getting infected with COVID-19. The Press Information Bureau (PIB) has clarified that the message is ‘fake’. So, the claim is FALSE.   When searched if using mustard oil can prevent a person from getting infected with Coronavirus, no information corroborating this was found either on the World Health Organization (WHO) website or on the Ministry for Health & Family Welfare (India) website. As the message went viral on social media, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) has debunked the claim and clarified that mustard oil cannot kill Coronavirus. It also said that, as of now, there is no treatment for Coronavirus and no type of oil can destroy it. So, mustard oil cannot prevent a person from getting infected with Coronavirus.During the search process, it was found that mustard oil has many health benefits. However, it is not a cure for coronavirus.

Let’s analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Image of dead bodies of Coronavirus victims in Italy.Fact: The image shows coffins containing the dead bodies of Lampedusa shipwreck victims. In 2013, a boat packed with around 500 African migrants caught fire and sank around half a mile from the Italian island Lampedusa leading to the death of more than 300 people. So, the claim isFALSE.   When the image is subjected to reverse image search technique, it was found in an article of ‘The Guardian’. The image had the following description with it- ‘EU delegates, including José Manuel Barroso, pay tribute before rows of coffins containing the bodies of Lampedusa shipwreck victims’. As per the article, in October 2013, a boat packed with around 500 African migrants caught fire and sank around half a mile from the Italian island Lampedusa leading to the death of more than 300 people. So, the image is 6 years old and has nothing to do with the recent Coronavirus outbreak in Italy.Italy is facing a severe crisis due to COVID-19. The country has till now recorded about 75,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 7,500 deaths.To conclude, old images from 2013 are being falsely shared as ‘Dead bodies of Coronavirus victims in Italy’.To conclude, ‘Mustard Oil’ has many health benefits but using it will not prevent a person from getting infected with Coronavirus.

Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: COVID-19 patients will not show symptoms for the first 14 days.Fact: On the WHO website, it can be read that the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days. But, most commonly COVID-19 patients show symptoms in around five days. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.When searched about the incubation period (i.e. the time between contracting the virus and showing symptoms of the disease) for COVID-19, on the WHO website, it can be read that ‘most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days’.Also, talking to CALTECH community members, David Ho (a Caltech trustee and an expert on viral epidemics) has said, ‘The incubation period from exposure to onset of symptoms is between four and six days; and if you want to cover 95–98 percent of the cases it is between three and 10 days. It’s pretty rare to have an incubation period outside of that range’. A similar timeframe was also found in a study led by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.To sum it up, it is very rare for COVID-19 patients to show symptoms after 14 days.

SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus is just a new type of Coronavirus  0 By Akhil Reddy  on  March 27, 2020    A A A    Twitter  Facebook  Reddit A lot of posts with images and videos are being shared on Facebook with a claim that humans knew about COVID-19 much before its outbreak in 2020. While some have posted the video clip of a Netflix series (‘My Secret Terrius’) as a proof, others have posted an image of Ramesh Gupta’s Zoology textbook claiming that it contains the medicine for COVID-19. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found here.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: COVID-19 was known to humans before its outbreak in 2020.Fact: The new SAR-CoV-2 virus (which cause COVID-19) was first reported in December 2019. All the old images and videos being shared on social media refer to the virus as Coronavirus, not as SAR-CoV-2 (or COVID-19). Coronaviruses were known to human decades ago. All the references made on social media were about the Coronaviruses, a general term for various viruses which cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Hence the claims made in the posts areMISLEADING.   On looking at both the image and video, it can be observed that both just refer to the term ‘Coronavirus’. On the WHO website, it can be read that ‘Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.’ So, just a reference to ‘Coronavirus’, in the image and video, cannot directly link them to the SAR-CoV-2 virus (a type of Coronavirus which causes COVID-19).In the ‘Virology’ magazine published in 2012, it can be read that ‘coronavirus disease was first described in 1931, with the first coronavirus (HCoV-229E) isolated from humans in 1965’. Before COVID-19, two other disease outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS‐CoV in 2012) were also caused in humans by Coronaviruses. More information about the previous strains of Coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2 (previously called as 2019-nCoV) can be seen here and types of Human Coronaviruses can be found be here.In the Zoology textbook, it was given that ‘common cold is caused by various kinds of viruses. In 75 percent of cases, it is due to Rhinovirus and in remaining cases, it is due to Coronavirus’. It does not mention about SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19. The medicines suggested in the book were for the treatment of common cold, not for COVID-19. On the WHO website, it can be read that, ‘to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019’. Also, the Press Information Bureau has clarified that the viral message is ‘fake’.कोरोना वायरस पर उपचार के भ्रामक संदेशो से सावधान रहें | #coronavirus infection पर हमेशा सटीक जानकारी के लिए स्वास्थ्य एवं परिवार कल्याण मंत्रालय, भारत सरकार के दिशानिर्देशों को पढ़े | pic.twitter.com/h34a6AygeC— PIB Fact Check (@PIBFactCheck) March 22, 2020 Coming to the video clip of Netflix series (‘My Secret Terrius’), it also just refers to the term ‘Coronavirus’ and says that the mortality rate of the new mutant virus is almost 90 percent. But, the overall mortality rate of COVID-19 was reported to be just around 5 percent. While the virus mentioned in the video clip affects a human in just 5 minutes, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has an incubation period of 1- 14 days. So, just a reference to ‘Coronavirus’ excited the social media users to share the video in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.Previously, a photo of a Dettol bottle, manufactured in October 2019, was also shared with a claim that Dettol can kill the new coronavirus, as ‘Coronavirus’ was mentioned on the bottle. FACTLY has debunked the claim and wrote a fact-check article, which can be read here.To sum it up, Coronaviruses were known to humans decades ago. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus is just a new type of Coronavirus.Did you watch our new video?   Share.

The posted India Today screenshot is a photoshopped version of the original telecast of Modi’s address to the nation on 24 March 2020, where he announced the 21-day lockdown from 25 March 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.When searched for the news about the extension, it was found that no such extension has been announced by PM Modi or the government. Nothing about such an extension to the current lockdown can be found on the official Twitter handles of PM Narendra Modi and PMO India.

Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of Muslims being trained to sneeze purposefully to spread Coronavirus.Fact: It is an old video. While the first Corona positive case in India was reported on 30 January 2020 in Kerala, the video was found being shared, in the context of Pakistan, on the internet at least since 29 January 2020. Also, the people in the video were not being trained to spread Coronavirus. They are doing a type of ‘Zikr’, a Sufi ritual, which involves body movement and heavy breathing. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. When the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, many similar videos, posted in January, were found in the search results. While the first Corona positive case in India was reported on 30 January 2020 in Kerala, the video was found being shared, in the context of Pakistan, on the internet at least since 29 January 2020. Many people on social media have shared the same video as related to Pakistan, which can be seen here and here.  Also, a TikTok star from Pakistan has posted the same video on his Facebook account on 30 January 2020. So, a two-month-old video that went viral in Pakistan is being shared now in India in the context of the Tablighi Jamaat incident. A Facebook user has posted the same video with the title – ‘Sufi people doing strange rituals.When searched if there is any such Sufi ritual, it was found that there are various orders among Sufis and each of them follows various rituals. One of those rituals, ‘Zikr’, is similar to the one shown in the video. Videos related to ‘Zikr’ can be watched here, here, here and here. But, even ‘Zikr’ is followed using different methods by different Sufi orders. In a ‘Zikr’ method called ‘Pan Anfas’, a combination of concentration, body movement, and heavy breathing is followed. More information regarding it can be read here.To sum it up, a Sufi ritual video falsely shared as ‘Muslims being trained to sneeze to spread COVID-19’. Did you watch our new video?   Share.

The advisory asks people to stop eating the bakery items as they are not washable and can get infected with virus easily.

The audio clip claims that Modi went to the US and has brought medicines, which will be only given to selected people in the name of vaccines for coronavirus. It is also being claimed that people who will be given these medicines will die. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post. Claim: Photos of medicines from the US which will be only given to selected people by the Indian government in the name of COVID-19 treatment to eliminate them.Fact: The photos are neither related to India nor the US. The photos were taken at Kota Kinabalu International Airport (Sabha, Malaysia) when the health equipment donated by the Chinese Government reached the airport. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   When the photos were run through the Google Reverse Image, all the four photos were found in a post on Facebook. The photos were posted by Shafie Apdal, the Chief Minister of Sabha state (Malaysia). He posted the same photos (and many other photos) and thanked the Chinese government for the donation of health equipment to fight COVID-19 in the State. The photos were taken at Kota Kinabalu International Airport (Sabha, Malaysia). The photos are neither related to India nor the US. Also, there was no mention of any medicine or vaccine in his post. More information regarding China’s donation to Sabha state can be read here, here and here.To sum it up, unrelated photos and an audio clip falsely shared as ‘Medicines from the US to be given to selected people in India for eliminating them’.Did you watch our new video?

The post claims that the first photo is of the people who died from Coronavirus in Italy and the second one is of Italy’s Prime Minister crying and expressing his helplessness that he couldn’t save Coronavirus patients in Italy. Let’s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim 1: Image of the people who died of Coronavirus in Italy.Fact: The photo is not related to recent Coronavirus deaths in Italy. It was taken in Frankfurt (Germany) in 2014 as part of an ‘art project’ in remembrance of 528 Katzbach victims of the Nazi concentration camp. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.   When the photo in the post was reverse image searched, the photo was found in an article published by a news organization, ‘South China Morning Post’. The article was published in 2014 and the photo credits were given to an organization called ‘Reuters’. Based on the description provided on Reuters’ website about the photo, it is understood that the photo was captured when some people had laid down on a pedestrian zone as part of an ‘art project’ in Frankfurt (Germany), in remembrance of 528 Katzbach victims of the Nazi concentration camp.Claim 2: Photo of the prime minister of Italy crying and expressing his helplessness that he couldn’t save Coronavirus patients in Italy.Fact: The person in the photo is not the PM of Italy. He is Jair Bolsonaro, the President of Brazil. The photo was taken when he cried at an ‘Evangelical Thanksgiving Service’. The PM of Italy has not expressed helplessness that he couldn’t save Coronavirus affected patients in Italy. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.  When the posted photo was cropped and searched using reverse image technique, the same photo was found in an article published on 17 December 2019 by a news organization called ‘Poder 360’. From the article, it is understood that the person in the photo is the President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro. The photo was taken when he participated in an ‘Evangelical Thanksgiving Service’, where he cried remembering the knife attack, which he suffered during the 2018 election campaign in Juiz de Fora (MG). So, the person in the posted photo is the President of Brazil, not the prime minister of Italy.When searched on the internet to see if the PM of Italy (Giuseppe Conte) has commented that he couldn’t save Coronavirus affected people in Italy, no such information published by any trusted news agency was found. Also, no information about it was found on the official Twitter account of Giuseppe Conte. Therefore, the PM of Italy has not expressed his helplessness that he couldn’t save Coronavirus affected patients in Italy. To summarize, unrelated photos are being falsely shared in the context of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy.Did you watch our new video?

Let’s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: After husband tested positive for coronavirus, wife fled from Banglore to Agra .Fact: The woman went to her parents place in Agra on 9 March, while her husband was confirmed positive for coronavirus on 12 March. Also, she didn’t enter Bangalore city. Karnataka government has also clarified that the woman didn’t flee to her parents’ place. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.   When searched about the posted information on the internet, an article published by ‘Times of India’ on 14 March 2020 was found. From the article, it can be read that “According to health officials, the woman, who recently returned from her honeymoon in Italy and Greece and was put under quarantine after her husband showed symptoms of the disease. She escaped from Bengaluru on 08 March, took a flight to New Delhi and travelled to Agra to be with her parents.” However, TOI later updated the article stating that the women left Bangalore on 09 March before her husband was not tested positive for coronavirus. Her husband was tested positive on 12 March. In the same article, it can be read that the couple travelled to Greece, Switzerland and France but not to Italy as mentioned in the post. So, the woman did not flee from quarantine as she left directly from Bengaluru airport on 09 March before her husband was tested positive.Karnataka’s medical education minister, K.Sudhakar has clarified that the couple reached Bengaluru on 08 March at 9:45 pm from Mumbai and from there the woman took an early morning flight at 1:40 am on 09 March to New Delhi, and from there, she took the 8.10 am Gatimaan Express train to Agra. A flowchart released by the Karnataka government showing the whereabouts of the Google employee can be seen below. More information related to this case can be seen here, and here.To sum it up, the news that the wife fled to her parents’ place after her husband was tested positive for coronavirus is false.

Let’s check the authenticity of the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of American President Donald Trump announcing that Roche Medical Company will launch the vaccine for COVID-19 next Sunday.Fact: In the video, American President Donald Trump hasn’t said that Roche Medical Company will launch the vaccine for COVID-19. He announced FDA’s approval of a Coronavirus ‘test’ developed by a company ‘Roche’ to increase and accelerate the country’s capacity to test for the virus. So, the claim isFALSE.   In the video clip posted, Donald Trump hands over the podium to Roche Diagnostics Chief Executive Officer for North America Matt Sause. Then Matt speaks- ‘Thank you, Mr. President.  So, from Roche, we want to thank the FDA for their rapid approval of our coronavirus test. We really appreciate the partnership with the CDC and the FDA to get that to market as fast as possible because it’s critical for us to make that available to help patients in need, and working with laboratories to get it up and going in the near future, which will bring hundreds of thousands of tests available to patients in need in the United States. So, thank you’. After Matt’s speech, the clip ends with Trump saying- ‘And you can do it.  You can do it.  A great company’. So, in the video clip, Roche Diagnostics CEO for North America Matt Sause thanked FDA (U.S Food and Drug Administration) for rapid approval of the coronavirus test developed by their company.When searched with keywords, the full video of the clip posted was found on ‘The White House’ website. In that video dated 13 March 2020 (Friday), Trump declares ‘National emergency’ and then opens $50 billion for the states and territories to fight against the disease. Later, Trump announces that the FDA has approved a Coronavirus test developed by ‘Roche’ to increase and accelerate the country’s capacity to test for the virus. He also said that he was expecting the availability of half a million additional tests early next week and would be announcing the locations for tests on Sunday. Later in the video, Vice President Pence and members of Coronavirus Task Force spoke in that press conference. From the Roche diagnostics website, it is found that the company has begun shipping of COVID-19 tests to laboratories across the US recently to begin testing of patients.As per the website of U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH), currently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with Coronavirus. But, Phase 1 of the clinical trial evaluating an investigational vaccine (mRNA-1273) designed to protect against COVID-19 has begun on 16 March. And it is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of that vaccine. The vaccine was developed by NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc.To sum it up, in the video, American President Donald Trump has announced that the FDA has approved a Coronavirus ‘test’ developed by a company ‘Roche’.

The archived version of the post can be found hereClaim: Most affected countries by COVID-19 are along the same 40-degree North latitude.Fact: 40-degree North latitude passes through some of the countries most affected by COVID-19 but does not pass through half of the locations given in the post. Also, it does not touch Wuhan (Hubei Province – where around 60% of all the positive cases are reported), which is at around 30-degree North latitude. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   In the world map, it can be seen that 40-degree North latitude passes through the following countries: Spain, Italy, Albania, Greece, Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan Kyrgyzstan, China, North Korea, Japan, US, and Portugal. The list of countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can be found on the WHO website. The top-10 most affected countries (as on 12 March 2020) are China, Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, France, Spain, Germany, US, Switzerland, and Japan.When we compare both the lists, it can be found there are only four countries (US, Spain, China, and Japan) through which the 40-degree North passes and are in the top-10 most affected countries. There are many more countries through which the 40-degree North passes and are not in the top-10 most affected list. Also, no positive COVID-19 cases were reported (as on 12 March 2020) in Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. [Also, North Korea]Even among the four countries, through which the 40-degree North\npasses and are in the top-10 most affected countries, in the US and China, it\ncan be observed that the 40-degree North does not pass through the most\naffected region in the respective country. The most affected regions in the US\nand China are Washington State and Hubei Province (Wuhan) respectively. The 40-degree\nNorth does not pass through them.To sum it up, not all the countries most affected by COVID-19 are on\nthe 40-degree North latitude.Did you watch our new video?   Share.

Let’s check the veracity of the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found hereClaim: A worker of Prince hotel in Mehdipatnam has tested positive for Coronavirus.Fact: The message is fake. In Telangana state, till date, only one confirmed case of Coronavirus is reported and the person who tested positive for the virus is a Software Engineer. So, the claim is FALSE.   When searched if any case of Coronavirus was reported in Mehdipatnam, no news reports confirming it were found. On visiting the ‘Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’ website for the number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus reported in the Telangana state, it was found to be one. In Telangana, the confirmed case of Coronavirus is a Software Engineer from Bangalore. And, the case was reported on 2 March 2020 i.e. prior to the date (8 March 2020) on which the Facebook post about the worker of Prince hotel was posted. So, the message is a fake one.Yesterday, Telangana Health Minister Etela Rajendra has said that there is no case of Coronavirus in the state now. The person who had earlier tested positive for the virus has now been tested negative and will be discharged soon.To summarize, the message that a worker of Prince hotel in Mehdipatnam, Hyderabad has tested positive for Coronavirus is fake.

The vaccine by Israeli scientists is yet to be approved  0 By Akhil Reddy  on  March 11, 2020    A A A    Twitter  Facebook  Reddit A post is being shared widely on social media with a claim that Israel scientists have discovered a vaccine for COVID-19 and there will be no more COVID-19 deaths. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: No more deaths from COVID-19 as Israel scientists have discovered a vaccine for COVID-19.Fact: Various vaccines proposed by Israel scientists and other researchers across the world are under development and are yet to be cleared for production and distribution. Israel’s MIGAL Research Institute is also in the process of producing a vaccine for COVID-19. According to WHO, as on 11 March 2020, there is no vaccine for COVID-19. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.   On the WHO website, it can be read that, ‘to date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19’.When searched on Google about Israeli scientists discovering a vaccine for COVID-19, various news articles were found in the search results. According to an article in ‘The Jerusalem Post’, Israel’s MIGAL Research Institute is in the process of developing a vaccine for COVID-19. Also, the vaccine is yet to go through the regulatory process. The same can be found on the website of MIGAL Galilee Research Institute. David Zigdon, CEO of MIGAL Galilee Research Institute, said, “Given the urgent global need for a human coronavirus vaccine, we are doing everything we can to accelerate development. Our goal is to produce the vaccine during the next 8-10 weeks, and to achieve safety approval in 90 days”. Also, in the ‘DRAFT landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines – 4 March 2020’ document released by WHO, 35 candidate vaccines are listed (all of them are at the pre-clinical stage). The name of ‘MIGAL Galilee Research Institute’ can be seen in the list and its vaccine is also at the pre-clinical stage. So, the vaccine being developed by Israeli scientists is not yet approved for human consumption.Also, on 6 March 2020, WHO has tweeted that “so far WHO has received applications for review & approval of 40 diagnostic tests, 20 vaccines are in development & many clinical trials of therapeutics are underway“. A vaccine must go through various stages of development before it gets distributed among the public. More info regarding the vaccine approval process can be found here and here.The posted Coronavirus vaccine photo is taken from ‘Alamy’ (stock pictures website).To sum it up, as of today, there is no vaccine for COVID-19. The vaccine by Israeli scientists is yet to be approved.Did you watch our new video?   Share.

Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Aaj Tak telecasted a news in which the Chinese PM said, ‘Reading Quran and offering namaz is the only cure for COVID-19’.Fact:  It is a clipped video of Aaj Tak’s fact-check. In the full version, it can be seen that Aaj Tak has debunked the claim and concluded that no such statement was made by the Chinese PM. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   When searched with the keywords shown in the video, the full version of the video was found on the ‘Aaj Tak’ website. In the video, it can be seen that they have fact-checked a video with the same claim. They have debunked the claim and concluded that no such statement was made by the Chinese PM. Also, Aaj Tak has published a fact-check article on the same claim. FACTLY has also debunked the same video in the first week of February. The fact-check article can be read here.Also, in the posted video, the photograph of Xi Jinping (President\nof the People’s Republic of China) was added. While the claim talks about the\nPrime Minister, the video shows the photo of the President.To sum it up, Aaj Tak’s fact-check video was clipped to falsely claim that Chinese PM said, ‘Quran is the only cure for COVID-19’.Did you watch our new video?

Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Aaj Tak channel telecasted a program that said drinking alcohol or weed can cure COVID-19.Fact:  Aaj Tak channel did not telecast any program that said drinking alcohol or weed can cure COVID-19. The posted photos are taken from their fact-check episode. In the episode, they debunk the claim and conclude that neither a peg of alcohol nor weed can cure COVID-19. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.   When searched for the news telecasted by Aaj Tak on Coronavirus, the episode, from which the photos were taken, was found on the ‘Aaj Tak HD’ YouTube channel. In the video, it can be seen that they do not claim that alcohol or weed can cure COVID-19. They debunk the posts which say that alcohol or weed can cure COVID-19.Any vaccine or medicine for COVID-19 No, as of now, there is no vaccine or medicine for COVID-19 Also, ‘World Health Organization Western Pacific’ has tweeted that ‘drinking alcohol does not protect you from #nCoV infection’ Another post (archived) claiming that ‘weed kills Coronavirus’ is being shared virally on social media. Vivek Agnihotri has also tweeted (archived) the same on his Twitter account.There is no evidence that weed kills Coronavirus. The picture was taken from a website where memes are created and posted.To sum it up, Aaj Tak did not telecast any program that said drinking alcohol or weed can cure COVID-19.Did you watch our new video?

A widely viral social media post claims that the preventive measures in the message were suggested by the UNICEF.The archived version of the post can be found here.But, before fact-checking the message, let’s try to know a bit about the virus. Now, let’ verify the claims made in the post.Claim 1: Precautionary measures suggested by the UNICEF.Fact: The viral message was not issued by the UNICEF. Some of the measures suggested in the message contradict the WHO’S view on COVID-19. Also, some have no scientific evidence. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.    UNICEF mainly caters to the needs of the children and young people across the globe. On the UNICEF’s website, it can be seen that it advised the parents on how to protect themselves and their children from COVID-19. Most of the measures suggested in the viral social media message were not found on the UNICEF’s website and some of the measures contradict the UNICEF’s and WHO’s views (on the use of mask and warm weather reducing the outbreak).Claim 2: Wearing a mask can prevent people from getting infected by COVID-19 since corona virus is large in size with a diameter of 400-500 micronsFact: According to WHO, people with no respiratory symptoms do not need to wear a medical mask. It recommends the use of masks for people who have symptoms of COVID-19 and for those taking care of individuals who have symptoms. Also, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted. Secondly, the size of the corona virus is not 400-500 microns, it is only 0.12 microns. Hence, the claim made in the post is onlyPARTIALLY TRUE.    On the WHO’s website, in the FAQ section on Coronavirus, it can be read that people with no symptoms need not wear a medical mask. It reads, ‘WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and misuse of masks. Use a mask only if you have respiratory symptoms (coughing or sneezing), have suspected COVID-19 infection with mild symptoms, or are caring for someone with suspected COVID-19 infection’. Even CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) does not recommend masks to healthy people.In one of the advisories released by the WHO, it can also be read that, ‘the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted. If masks are to be used, this measure must be combined with hand hygiene and other IPC measures to prevent the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCov…Wearing medical masks when not indicated may cause unnecessary cost, procurement burden and create a false sense of security that can lead to neglecting other essential measures such as hand hygiene practices. Furthermore, using a mask incorrectly may hamper its effectiveness to reduce the risk of transmission’. The guidelines regarding how to use masks can be watched here.Talking about the use of masks, ‘The Guardian’ writes, ‘Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness)…masks will probably make little difference if you’re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply’.On its website, WHO writes, ‘Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely’.According to an article published in ‘The New England Journal of Medicine’, ‘the electron micrographs of negative-stained 2019-nCoV particles were generally spherical with some pleomorphism. Diameter varied from about 60 to 140 nm. Virus particles had quite distinctive spikes, about 9 to 12 nm, and gave virions the appearance of a solar corona’. So, the size of 2019-nCoV coronavirus is around 125 nm (0.125 microns). The smallest particles are 0.06 microns, and the largest are 0.14 microns. The electron microscopy image showing SARS-CoV-2 virus can be seen here.An article published by the ‘Business Insider’ talks about the types of masks and their effectiveness. It can be read here.  Eric Toner, a scientist at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says the following about wearing a mask, ‘There’s little harm in it. But it’s not likely to be very effective in preventing it’. In the ‘Daily Mail’ article, it can be read that ‘surgical masks, which have proved popular, rarely filter out particles smaller than 5 microns – and coronavirus is only 0.12 microns’.Claim 3: Coronavirus live up to 12 hours on metal, 9 hours on fabric, and 10 minutes on the human hand.Fact: According to WHO, ‘the studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days.’ There are no defined timelines for each surface. The topic is yet to be studied and confirmed. Hence the claim made in the post remains UNVERIFIED.    On the WHO website, it can be read that ‘it is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment)’.An explainer by ‘Reuters’ on ‘How long can coronavirus survive on surfaces?’ can be read here and an analysis of earlier studies on similar coronaviruses can be read here. There is no defined answer on the topic. It is yet to be studied and confirmed.Claim 4: Outbreak of COVID-19 will be stopped by the hot weather conditions.Fact: As of now, there is no scientific evidence to show that hot weather conditions will stop the outbreak of COVID-19. According to the CDC, ‘it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather becomes warmer.’. Hence, the claim made in the post remains UNVERIFIED.    In an article published by the ‘National Geographic’ on the topic, it can be read that, ‘viruses that cause influenza or milder coronavirus colds do tend to subside in warmer months because these types of viruses have what scientists refer to as “seasonality”. But it’s highly uncertain that SARS-CoV-2 will behave the same way. Those currently studying the disease say their research is too early to predict how the virus will respond to changing weather’. Similar views about the virus can be also seen in the ‘Will heat kill the coronavirus?’ article, published in the ‘New Scientist’.According to the CDC, ‘it is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when the weather becomes warmer.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing’. The same can be seen on the WHO’s website. WHO’s Dr Maria Van Kerkhove’s answer on the same topic can be watched here. Claim 5: Gargling with warm water and salt will prevent COVID-19.Fact: WHO does not mention ‘gargling with warm water and salt’ as a preventive measure. In an email to AFP, the WHO said, ‘We have seen no convincing evidence that rinsing one’s mouth with diluted saline water will provide protection from this disease’. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.In a press release regarding misinformation on Coronavirus, UNICEF has clarified that the message circulating on social media as UNICEF communication is not true. Also, ‘UNICEF Cambodia’ has tweeted the photo of the message and called it ‘fake’.We would like to inform our audiences that the news below attributed to UNICEF is fake. UNICEF Cambodia is NOT the author of this post. Stay informed by following UNICEF official platforms.For more information on #coronavirus, go to https://t.co/9F30DkELad pic.twitter.com/T0zXMYpMGS— UNICEF Cambodia (@UNICEFCambodia) March 5, 2020 To sum it up, the viral message regarding COVID-19 was not issued by the UNICEF.

Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of Police killing COVID-19 affected people in China.Fact: The posted video was edited with three unrelated clips to falsely claim that Police with arms are killing people. The Yiwu Police have clarified that the armed Police in the video were on their duty to kill a rabid dog. And, the last clip is related to an accident. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.The number ‘G1796’ can be seen on the Police car. So, when searched with the keyword – ‘G1796’ on Google, an article by ‘CGTN’ was found in the search results. In the article, the clarification given by the Yiwu Police Bureau regarding the video can be seen. The Police said – ‘At 11:37 a.m. on February 1, Yiwu Police received a report from civilians asking for help to handle a ravenous dog, which had been hurting people in Futian neighbourhood. The policemen shot the dog after evaluating the danger it imposed on humans’.In the video, there are three different clips. The Yiwu Police have said that the first clip is relevant to them and it is not related to the other two clips show in the video. While no credible information was found about the second clip, it was found that the third clip in the video is related to a road accident in China. In a video uploaded by ‘CGTN’ on YouTube, the Wuzu Police official, showing the accident location, explains that ‘a 15-year-old Liu took his cousin on the motorcycle and due to wrong operation, the vehicle rammed into the cemented curb in the afternoon on January 29’. The statements of the Doctor and Liu’s cousin, regarding the accident, can be also watched in the video. The accident video was also fact-checked by ‘France 24’ previously.To sum it up, three unrelated clips joined to falsely claim that Police are killing COVID-19 affected people in China.Did you watch our new video in the DECODE series?

Let’s try to analyze the authenticity of the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Video of bats found under the tiles of many roofs in Hubei, China. They were the source of Coronavirus.Fact: The video was not taken in China. It’s an old video uploaded on 05 July 2011 by a Miami based roofing company called ‘Istueta Roofing’. The bats in the video were found under the tiles during the process of replacing a roof for a customer in Miami (US). Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.From the ‘Economic Times’ article, it is learnt that some of the studies suspect that the 2019 novel Coronavirus may have come from bats. But, WHO has officially not yet declared the origin/source of the virus.Using the ‘Invid’ plugin, keyframes of the video were obtained. When these keyframes were reverse image searched using ‘Yandex’, the same video was found to be uploaded on Youtube by ‘Istueta Roofing’ on 05 July 2011. According to the description given below the video by the uploader, it is understood that the bats were found in the process of removing tiles from a customer’s old roof in Miami (US) by a roofing company called ‘Istueta Roofing’, which offers services for roofing needs in South Florida. So, this is not a video from China as mentioned in the post. More information about ‘Istueta Roofing’ can be found here. To summarize, a video that was posted by a Miami based roofing company in 2011 is being falsely shared in the context of the coronavirus outbreak in China.

Also, social media users were questioning about how Dettol company knew about the Coronavirus back in October 2019 (novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first reported from Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019). Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim: Dettol kills Coronavirus. The company knew about the Coronavirus back in October 2019.Fact: The ‘Coronavirus’ mentioned on Dettol bottle is the previous strains of Coronavirus, not the 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Also, Dettol manufacturer (‘RB’) has clarified that they do not yet have more details of the new virus and are not yet in a position to confirm levels of effectiveness against the new strain. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.When searched about the news on Google, it was found that RB (Reckitt Benckiser), the manufacturer of Dettol, has given a clarification on the viral pictures claiming that Dettol can kill ‘2019-nCoV’ virus. In the Livemint article, it can be read that the company said, ‘As this is an emerging outbreak, RB, like all manufacturers, doesn’t yet have access to the new virus (2019-nCoV) for testing and, as a result, are not yet in a position to confirm levels of effectiveness against the new strain’.On the WHO website, it can be read that ‘a novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. The new, or “novel” coronavirus, now called 2019-nCoV, had not previously detected before the outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019.’. The ‘Coronavirus’ mentioned on the Dettol bottle is regarding some of the previous strains of Coronavirus, not about the 2019 novel Coronavirus. More information about the previous strains of Coronavirus and the 2019-nCoV can be seen here.To sum it up, ‘Coronavirus’ mentioned on Dettol was about some previous strains of Coronavirus, not 2019-nCoV.Did you watch our new video in the DECODE series?

Let’s analyze the claim made in those posts.Claim: Videos of Pigs being buried in China due to the Coronavirus outbreak.Fact:  The videos posted are old. They are in no way related to the recent Coronavirus outbreak. So, the claim is FALSE.Video-1 (Archived): The video can be seen to have been uploaded on Youtube in March 2019. In the description, it is mentioned that the pigs were buried due to the outbreak of ‘African Swine Fever’. Also, the novel Coronavirus was first reported in the last week of December 2019. So, this video is not related to the recent Coronavirus outbreak. Video-2 (Archived): The video can be seen to have been uploaded on Youtube in March 2019. In the YouTube video, the clip related to the video-1 can also be seen. So, this video is also not related to the recent Coronavirus outbreak.Video-3 (Archived):This video is also found to have been uploaded in November 2019. In the description, it is mentioned that the pigs were buried due to the outbreak of ‘Hog Cholera’. As the outbreak of Coronavirus was first reported in the last week of December 2019, this video is also not related to the recent Coronavirus outbreak.More information regarding the diseases like African Swine Fever and Hog Cholera in pigs can be found here, here and here. The differences between the ‘African Swine Fever’ and ‘2019 novel Coronavirus’ can be read here.To sum it up, old videos are being falsely shared as ‘Pigs buried in China due to the Coronavirus outbreak’.Did you watch our new video in the DECODE series?

No, an old unrelated video.  0 By Akhil Reddy  on  February 4, 2020    A A A    Twitter  Facebook  Reddit A video is being shared widely on social media with a claim that all the people shown in the video have died due to the recent novel Coronavirus outbreak. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim:  Video of a family died due to novel Coronavirus.Fact: The video was found on the internet at least since the last week of December 2019. But the first death from the novel Coronavirus was reported only in the second week of January 2020. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.When the screenshots of the video were run through the Yandex Reverse Image Search, many similar videos were found in the search results. It can be found that the same video was uploaded on YouTube in December 2019. Also, a user has tweeted the same video on 1 January 2020, with a claim different from the post.While the exact context of the video cannot be ascertained, it is definitely not related to the novel Coronavirus outbreak; because the first death from novel Coronavirus was reported only in the second week of January 2020.To sum it up, an old unrelated video falsely shared as ‘family died due to infection from the novel Coronavirus’.Did you watch our new video in the DECODE series?

But, it does not consist of 57 floors.In the post, it is mentioned, the new hospital is of 57 floors and was constructed in 19 days. So, when searched on YouTube with the keywords ‘57 floors hospital constructed in 19 days’, many search results were obtained. In the search results, the same video was found.

The visuals between -1:37 and -1:27 in the viral video can be seen in that video during 0:00 and 0:19. The video shows the construction of a 57-storey skyscraper in 19 days in Changsha, Hunan Province (China). The visuals between -0:47 and -0:40 in the viral video can be seen in a 2011 video (0:25 to 0:32) that shows the construction of a 6-storey building in 5 days.

The two ways are: “1. Colored side out if you’re sick and do not want to spread your germs around. 2. White side out (this is the filter part) for when you’re not sick and you want to stop germs from getting in”. Let’s try to analyze the claim made in the post.The archived version of the post can be found here.Claim:  Two ways of wearing a surgical mask: Colored side out if you are sick and White side out if you do not want to become sick.Fact: There is only one way of wearing a three-layered surgical mask. The colored side of the surgical mask should face outwards. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.When searched regarding the ways of wearing a surgical mask, no information was found regarding the ways mentioned in the post. In an article published by ‘The Strait Times’, in September-2019, it can be read that ‘there is only one way to wear the good quality surgical masks that most people are familiar with – with the colored side facing outwards’. Also, in the document released by the ‘Centre for Health Protection’, it can be read that, ‘in general, the colored side/the side with folds facing downwards of the surgical mask should face outwards with the metallic strip uppermost’.Also, a similar suggestion can be seen in the ‘wiki How’ article on ‘How to Put on a Medical Mask’.Some videos by the experts on how to wear the surgical mask can be watched here and here. The Health Promotion Board of Singapore also released posters on its Facebook page explaining how to wear a mask.To sum it up, there is only one way to wear a three-layered surgical mask: Colored-side outwards.Did you watch our new video in the DECODE series?

If she had really died due to Coronavirus, her body would have been quarantined.The official Twitter handle of Malaysia’s Health Ministry (‘KKMPutrajaya’) has also tweeted the same article of ‘Harian Metro’ and asked the people not to share the fake news regarding Coronavirus.Keluarga minta henti sebar video kononnya anak meninggal dunia kerana #coronavirus Rakyat Malaysia, hentikan menyebar berita dan video palsu. #2019nCoV https://t.co/dxYuJG2GLU— KKMPutrajaya (@KKMPutrajaya) January 28, 2020 Also, Nazirul, a friend of the girl, has shared the reports related to the girl’s death on his Twitter account and requested to delete the fake news.Tolong bagi dia rehat dengan tenang .

Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE.At the beginning of the video, the words ‘Pasar EXTREME Langowan’ (English translation – ‘Market Extreme Langowan’) can be seen. So, when searched with those words on Google, many similar videos were found in the search results. A user has uploaded the same video on YouTube, in December-2019, with the title: ‘VIRALL Pasar EXTREME Langowan INDONESIA’. Langowan is in Indonesia.At 0:20 secs, in the video, the words ‘KANTOR PASAR LANGOWAN’ can be seen on a poster hanged on the wall. The English translation of the words– ‘Office of the Langowan Market’. This indicates that the video was taken at the Langowan market (Indonesia), not at the Wuhan market (China).Also, many other similarities can be seen when the photos of the Langowan market on the ‘Getty Images’ website are compared with the visuals in the posted video.To sum it up, the video shows a market in Langowan (Indonesia), not in Wuhan (China).Did you watch our new video in the DECODE series?
